GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) is one of the basic technologies for the success of DeepSeek-R1. In short, the GRPO algorithm discards the critic model and the value function approximation, and instead calculates the policy gradient through relative comparison of samples within the group, thereby effectively reducing the instability of training and improving learning efficiency. Recently, AI engineer and technical writer Andriy Burkov released a tutorial on "Writing GRPO Code from Scratch", which introduces how to build a distributed reinforcement learning process using GRPO based on the Qwen2.5–1.5B-Instruct model.

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to build a distributed reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline using the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to finetune a language model for math, logic, and coding tasks. These are tasks for which there exist a unique correct answer that can be easily verified with the ground truth answer using a simple string comparison.

GRPO was invented by DeepSeek and used to finetune DeepSeek R1 and R1-Zero models to excel in math and logic tasks by learning to generate a chain of thought (CoT). You will find a detailed overview of how R1 and R1-Zero were trained in this article.

The objective of this tutorial is to transform a generalist language model Qwen2.5–1.5B-Instruct into a math problem solver. We will code GRPO from scratch and then integrate it with several popular libraries and tools to implement a distributed training pipeline, including:

- **PyTorch:** For tensor operations and distributed training.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** For loading pre-trained language models and tokenizers.
- **FlashAttention2:** For optimized attention mechanisms that help reduce memory usage and improve training speed.
- **Weights & Biases (wandb):** For experiment tracking, visualization, and model versioning.

The tutorial is organized into several parts. We start with the basic setup and imports, then move on to data formatting and answer extraction, dataset preparation, evaluation functions, reward functions, training setup and execution, and finally loading and testing the model. In the process, we implement the GRPO algorithm from scratch.

### Part 1: Basic Setup and Imports

In this first part, we install and import all necessary modules. We also set up our environment by configuring random seeds for reproducibility and initializing environment variables required for experiment tracking. In addition, we install and import libraries that provide optimized transformer attention mechanisms (FlashAttention2) and reporting (Weights and Biases):

Copy`!pip install tf-keras # for some reason, Hugging Face cannot work without it !pip install flash-attn # FlashAttention2 !pip install wandb # Weights and Biases !pip install 'accelerate>=0.26.0' !pip install transformers # Hugging Face Transformers API !pip install datasets # Hugging Face Datasets API  # Import necessary libraries # Basic Python libraries for various operations import random import copy import re import os import numpy as np import wandb  # PyTorch and related libraries for deep learning import torch import torch.nn as nn from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence  # Hugging Face libraries for transformer models from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer from datasets import load_dataset  def set_random_seed(seed: int = 42):     """     Set the random seed for reproducibility across Python, NumPy, and PyTorch.      Args:         seed (int): The seed value to use for random number generation.      Returns:         None      Explanation:         1. Sets seed for Python's built-in random module for basic random operations.         2. Sets seed for NumPy, ensuring consistent random number generation in array operations.         3. Sets seed for PyTorch CPU operations.         4. If CUDA is available, sets seed for all GPU devices.         5. Configures cuDNN to ensure deterministic behavior:            - Sets deterministic flag to True, ensuring reproducible results.            - Disables benchmarking to prevent algorithm selection based on hardware.      Note:         Setting deterministic behavior may impact performance but ensures consistent results         across multiple runs, which is crucial for debugging and research.     """     # Set the seed for Python's built-in random module     random.seed(seed)     # Set the seed for NumPy     np.random.seed(seed)     # Set the seed for PyTorch     torch.manual_seed(seed)     if torch.cuda.is_available():         torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)     # Ensure deterministic behavior in cuDNN (may impact performance)     torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True     torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False  # Call the function to set random seed for reproducibility set_random_seed(42)  # Set environment variables for Weights & Biases (wandb) logging os.environ["WANDB_API_KEY"] = "USE YOUR KEY" os.environ["WANDB_PROJECT"] = "GRPO-Qwen-1.5-Instruct-Multi-GPU"`

The code above performs the following tasks:

- **Setting a random seed:** The `set_random_seed` function ensures reproducibility by setting the seed for Python's random module, NumPy, and PyTorch. It also configures PyTorch's cuDNN backend for deterministic behavior.
- **Environment variable configuration:** We set the `WANDB_API_KEY` and `WANDB_PROJECT` environment variables to enable experiment tracking with Weights & Biases.
- **Import of necessary packages:** The script imports all the necessary modules for the pipeline, including: Below is a detailed explanation of what each import is for:
- **random:** Helps with dataset shuffling and random operations.
- **copy:** Provides functions for deep copying objects.
- **re:** Provides regular expression support for text processing.
- **numpy (np):** Enables numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **torch:** Provides GPU-accelerated tensor operations and deep learning primitives.
- **torch.nn:** Contains neural network modules and operations.
- **pad_sequence:** Handles padding of variable-length sequences for batch processing.
- **AutoTokenizer** & **AutoModelForCausalLM:** Load pre-trained language models and their tokenizers.
- **load_dataset:** Loads datasets from Hugging Face's datasets library.

### Part 2: Data Formatting and Answer Extraction

In this section, we define how our data is formatted and how to extract the answer segments from both the model's output and the dataset. To ensure that the model outputs its response in a consistent format, we define a system prompt. The prompt instructs the model to generate output in an XML-like format containing `<reasoning>` and `<answer>` tags. We then provide two functions:

1. **`extract_answer_from_model_output`****:** This function takes the model's output text and extracts the content within the `<answer>` tags.
2. **`extract_answer_from_dataset`****:** This function extracts the expected answer from the GSM8K dataset, which separates the answer using the `"####"` delimiter:

Copy`SYSTEM_PROMPT = """ Respond in the following format: <reasoning> ... </reasoning> <answer> ... </answer> """  def extract_answer_from_model_output(text):    """    Extracts the value from the last <answer> tag in the text.     Args:        text (str): The model-generated text containing XML-style <answer> tags.     Returns:        str or None: The content inside the <answer> tags, or None if no valid answer is found.     Explanation:        1. Splits the text on the <answer> tag to isolate content after the tag.        2. Checks if at least one <answer> tag exists in the text.        3. For the last <answer> segment:           - Verifies it contains a closing </answer> tag.           - Extracts only the content between the tags.        4. Returns None if the answer is empty (just "...") or if tags are missing.    """    # Split on <answer> and take everything after the last occurrence    parts = text.split("<answer>")    if len(parts) < 2:  # No <answer> tag found        return None    last_part = parts[-1]     # Extract content up to </answer>    if "</answer>" not in last_part:        return None    answer = last_part.split("</answer>")[0].strip()    return None if answer == "..." else answer  def extract_answer_from_dataset(text):    """    Extracts the answer from the GSM8K dataset examples.     Args:        text (str): The dataset example text containing a question and answer.     Returns:        str or None: The extracted answer part after the '####' delimiter, or None if not found.     Explanation:        1. Checks if the text contains the '####' delimiter that separates question from answer.        2. If found, splits the text at this delimiter and returns the second part (the answer).        3. The answer is stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.        4. Returns None if no delimiter is present.    """    if "####" not in text:        return None    return text.split("####")[1].strip()`

In the above code:

- **`SYSTEM_PROMPT`****:** This string variable instructs the model to respond with its chain-of-thought in the `<reasoning>` tag and the final answer in the `<answer>` tag. The use of this consistent format makes it easier to extract and evaluate the answer.
- **`extract_answer_from_model_output`****:** This function splits the generated text by the `<answer>` tag, ensuring that only the content within the last occurrence of the tag is extracted. If the tag is missing or the answer is not valid (for example, it is a placeholder `"..."`), the function returns `None`.
- **`extract_answer_from_dataset`****:** Given that the GSM8K dataset separates the answer using a delimiter (`"####"`), this function extracts the expected answer by splitting the text on that delimiter.

### Part 3: Dataset Preparation

In this part we prepare the GSM8K dataset for training. GSM8K is a dataset of 8.5K high quality linguistically diverse grade school math word problems created by human problem writers. We will use the examples from this dataset to train our model in the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm: the model will generate several sample probelem solutions, we will compare these solutions to the ground truth number from a GSM8K example and, if there's a match, we will provide a high reward to the RL algorithm (GRPO) which will update the model's weights so that the chance of getting the high reward next time is increased.

We first load the dataset from Hugging Face and then format each example to include a system prompt and a user prompt. We also extract the expected answer from the dataset. Two helper functions are defined here:

1. **`prepare_dataset`****:** Loads and prepares the GSM8K dataset by creating a prompt that includes a system prompt (with the formatting instructions) and a user message (the question). It also extracts the answer from the dataset.
2. **`build_prompt`****:** Concatenates the list of message dictionaries into a single prompt string. This ensures consistency in how the prompt is constructed during both training and inference.

Copy`def prepare_dataset(split="train"):    """    Load and prepare the GSM8K dataset for training with string prompts.     Args:        split (str): The dataset split to load ("train" or "test"). Defaults to "train".     Returns:        list: A list of formatted examples, each containing a prompt string and answer.     Explanation:        1. Loads the GSM8K dataset from the Hugging Face datasets hub.        2. For each example in the dataset:           - Creates a list of messages with system prompt and the question.           - Converts this list into a single string prompt using build_prompt().           - Extracts the answer from the dataset example.           - Creates a formatted example dictionary with prompt and answer.        3. Returns the list of formatted examples ready for model training or evaluation.    """    data = load_dataset('openai/gsm8k', 'main')[split]    formatted_data = []    for example in data:        # Convert list of messages to a single string prompt.        prompt_str = build_prompt([            {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},            {"role": "user", "content": example["question"]}        ])        formatted_example = {            "prompt": prompt_str,  # Now a string rather than a list.            "answer": extract_answer_from_dataset(example["answer"])        }        formatted_data.append(formatted_example)    return formatted_data  def build_prompt(messages):    """    Build a single prompt string from a list of messages.     Args:        messages (list): A list of message dictionaries, each with 'role' and 'content' keys.     Returns:        str: A concatenated string of all message contents.     Explanation:        1. Takes a list of message dictionaries in the typical chat format.        2. Extracts the 'content' field from each message and strips whitespace.        3. Joins all content strings with newlines to create a single prompt.        4. This preserves the training format while converting from structured messages to a string.    """    return "\n".join([msg["content"].strip() for msg in messages])`

### Part 4: Evaluation Functions

Evaluation is crucial to track the model's progress. In this part, we define functions that allow us to evaluate the model on a set of examples. The evaluation functions perform the following tasks:

- **Tokenize the prompt and generate a response:** The model's output is generated given the tokenized prompt.
- **Extract the predicted answer:** The answer is extracted from the generated response.
- **Compare the predicted answer with the expected answer:** This comparison is done using exact matching as well as numeric equivalence checks.

Two helper functions, `_extract_last_number` and `_extract_single_number`, are used to extract numbers from text. The main evaluation function, `evaluate_model`, uses these helpers to determine if the predicted answer is correct:

Copy`def extract_last_number(text):    """    Extracts the last number appearing in the text.     Args:        text (str): The text to extract a number from.     Returns:        float or None: The last number in the text, or None if no number is found.     Explanation:        1. Removes dollar signs and percent symbols from the text.        2. Uses regex to find a number that appears at the end of the text (possibly after whitespace).        3. The pattern matches numbers that appear at the end of the string, with or without decimal points.        4. Returns the found number as a float, or None if no match is found.    """    text = text.replace('$', '').replace('%', '')    pattern = r'(?:^|\s|=)\s*(-?\d*\.?\d+)\s*$'    match = re.search(pattern, text)    return float(match.group(1)) if match else None  def extract_single_number(text):    """    Extracts a single number from text if exactly one number is present.     Args:        text (str): The text to extract a number from.     Returns:        float or None: The single number in the text, or None if zero or multiple numbers are found.     Explanation:        1. Uses regex to find all numbers in the text (including negative numbers and decimals).        2. If exactly one number is found, returns it as a float.        3. If zero or multiple numbers are found, returns None.    """    numbers = re.findall(r'-?\d*\.?\d+', text)    return float(numbers[0]) if len(numbers) == 1 else None  def evaluate_model(model, tokenizer, eval_examples, device):    """    Evaluates the model on a set of examples and prints detailed results.     Args:        model: The language model to evaluate.        tokenizer: The tokenizer for encoding inputs and decoding outputs.        eval_examples (list): List of evaluation examples, each containing "prompt" and "answer".        device: The device (CPU or GPU) to run evaluation on.     Returns:        float: The accuracy percentage (correct predictions / total examples * 100).     Explanation:        1. Sets the model to evaluation mode.        2. For each example in the evaluation set:           - Encodes the prompt and generates a response using the model.           - Extracts the predicted answer from the generated response.           - Compares the predicted answer with the expected answer using multiple methods:             a. Exact string matching             b. Single number extraction and comparison             c. Last number extraction and comparison           - Prints detailed information about each example.        3. Calculates and returns the overall accuracy.        4. Returns the model to training mode.    """    model.eval()    correct = 0    total = len(eval_examples)    print("\n" + "="*50)    print("EVALUATION ON", total, "EXAMPLES")    print("="*50)     for example in eval_examples:        # Get the prompt and expected answer        full_prompt = example["prompt"]        expected = example["answer"]         # Tokenize and generate response        inputs = tokenizer.encode(full_prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)        with torch.no_grad():            outputs = model.generate(                inputs,                max_new_tokens=512,                temperature=0.7,                num_return_sequences=1,                pad_token_id=tokenizer.pad_token_id,                eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,                forced_eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,                early_stopping=False,            )        response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)         try:            # Extract answer and check correctness            predicted = extract_answer_from_model_output(response)             # Try different matching methods            if predicted == expected:  # Exact match                is_correct = True            else:                # Try single number matching                pred_num = extract_single_number(str(predicted))                exp_num = extract_single_number(str(expected))                if pred_num is not None and exp_num is not None and pred_num == exp_num:                    is_correct = True                else:                    # Try last number matching                    pred_num = extract_last_number(str(predicted))                    exp_num = extract_last_number(str(expected))                    is_correct = (pred_num is not None and exp_num is not None and                                pred_num == exp_num)             # Update counter for correct answers            if is_correct:                correct += 1             # Print evaluation details            print("\nPrompt:")            print(full_prompt)            print("\nExpected Answer:")            print(expected)            print("\nExtracted Answer:")            print(predicted)            print("\nFull Generated Response:")            print(response)            print("\nCorrect:", "✓" if is_correct else "✗")            print("-"*50)         except Exception as e:            print("\nFailed to parse model output for prompt:")            print(full_prompt)            print("Error:", e)            print("-"*50)     # Calculate and print final accuracy    accuracy = (correct / total) * 100    print(f"\nAccuracy: {accuracy:.2f}% ({correct}/{total})")    print("="*50)     # Return model to training mode    model.train()    return accuracy`

In the above code:

- `_extract_last_number` extracts the final numeric value from a text string, ensuring it is separated properly and free from extraneous symbols.
- `_extract_single_number` attempts to extract a single numeric value from a string and returns it only if one number is found.
- `evaluate_model`:
- Sets the model to evaluation mode.
- Iterates over each evaluation example, builds the prompt, tokenizes it, and generates a response.
- Extracts the predicted answer and compares it to the expected answer using exact matching and numeric equivalence (using the helper functions).
- Logs and prints detailed evaluation information for each example and computes the overall accuracy.

### Part 5: Reward Functions

In reinforcement learning, reward functions guide the training process by providing feedback on the model's output. In our pipeline, we define two reward functions:

1. **`correctness_reward`****:** This function assigns rewards based on whether the generated answer is correct. It compares the extracted answer from the model output with the expected answer, using both exact string matching and numeric equivalence checks. A exact match earns a higher reward (2.0), while a match based on numeric equivalence receives a smaller reward (1.5).
2. **`format_reward`****:** This function encourages the model to adhere to the desired XML-like output format. It provides a small reward for the presence of the `<reasoning>`, `</reasoning>`, `<answer>`, and `</answer>` tags in the generated text. We use a relatively value of 0.05 for each of the four pieces because the model is already capable of using these tags from previous supervised finetuning step, so we give this small reward so that it doesn't forget to do that because of the RL updates.

Copy`def correctness_reward(prompts, completions, answer, **kwargs):    """    Assigns a reward based on the correctness of the model's answer.     Args:        prompts (list): List of input prompts.        completions (list): List of model completions, each containing content.        answer (list): List of expected answers.        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

### Part 6: DataParallel GRPO From Scratch

In this section, we implement all the building blocks of the GRPO algorithm from scratch. The implementation assumes that the machine running the code has at least 2 GPUs. We use PyTorch's `DataParallel` API to distribute the policy model across the GPU cores, one copy of the model per GPU core. The batch is split between the GPU cores.

### Part 7: Training Setup and Execution

In this section, we put together all components to set up and run the training. We begin by loading the pre-trained model and tokenizer, prepare evaluation data, and then do reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using the our own `train_with_grpo` we implemented from scratch above.

Key steps include:

- **Model and Tokenizer Initialization:** The model `"Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"` is loaded with optimized settings (using `torch.bfloat16` and FlashAttention2). The tokenizer is also loaded, and its padding token is set to the end-of-sequence token. Loading a model with `torch.bfloat16` converts its parameters to use 16 bits instead of 32 bits per number, which cuts the model's memory usage in half and can make training faster on modern GPUs.
- **Initial Evaluation:** Before fine-tuning, the model is evaluated on a few examples to establish a baseline performance.
- **Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RL):** The training function `train_with_grpo` implementing GRPO from scratch is configured with the appropriate training arguments and reward functions. The RL training then proceeds on the remaining training data.
- **Final Evaluation and Model Saving:** After RL fine-tuning, the model is evaluated again, and the final model is saved.

In the code below:

- The device is determined (GPU if available, otherwise CPU).
- The pre-trained Qwen2.5–1.5B-Instruct model and tokenizer are loaded. The tokenizer's pad token is set to the eos_token.
- A small subset of the dataset is reserved for evaluation to provide a baseline.
- The model is optimized for memory efficiency by enabling gradient checkpointing and disabling KV caching.
- **Step 1:** The model is evaluated before fine-tuning to establish a baseline accuracy.
- **Step 2:** Reinforcement learning fine-tuning is performed using the `train_with_grpo` function with our defined reward functions (`format_reward` and `correctness_reward`, combined into `combined_reward`). The model is trained using a multi-GPU.
- **Step 3:** The final, fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved to disk.

We used the following hyperparameters for our GRPO training pipeline:

#### Training Configuration

These parameters configure the reinforcement learning fine-tuning run using the GRPO algorithm. We set them as follows:

- **num_iterations=1** The number of outer iterations where a new reference model is created from the current policy model. One iteration is one pass over the entire dataset.
- **num_steps=500** The training loop will perform a maximum of 500 steps, each processing a batch of examples.
- **batch_size=7** Each step processes 7 examples per batch which, in the case of 8 GPUs, puts 1 example at each GPU. One GPU (0) is used as the master by `DataParallel` for aggregating gradients and gathering outputs.
- **num_generations=14** For every prompt in the training data, the trainer will generate 14 different completions. These multiple generations are used to compute a relative advantage (or reward signal) that guides the RL update. Reduce this number if you have GPUs with less VRAM.
- **max_completion_length=400** When generating completions (the "response" portion of the sequence), the generation is capped at 400 tokens. This limits the length of the outputs produced by the model during the RL phase. Reduce this number if you have GPUs with less VRAM.
- **beta=0.04** The coefficient for the KL divergence penalty in the GRPO loss function. This controls how much the model is allowed to diverge from the reference model.
- **learning_rate=5e-6** The learning rate for RL finetuning. A relatively low learning rate is used for stable policy updates.
- **mu=1** The number of policy updates performed for each batch of rollout data. In our case, we perform just one update per batch.
- **epsilon=0.1** The clipping parameter for the PPO component of GRPO. This prevents the policy from changing too drastically in a single update.

The model is evaluated both before and after fine-tuning to measure the improvement in accuracy. Finally, the fine-tuned model is saved to the "grpo_finetuned_model" directory.

### Conclusion

Let's take a quick look at the training process.

First, after the initial configuration, we can see that the accuracy before running GRPO is 23.33%.

Copy``Accuracy: 23.33% (7/30) ================================================== Pre-GRPO Accuracy: 23.33%  Starting RL fine-tuning using GRPO... wandb: Currently logged in as: burkov to https://api.wandb.ai.

Then after 1 round of GRPO iterations of 500 steps, the following figure shows the relevant training dynamics:

After the training is completed, it is natural to conduct a new round of evaluation on the model. Here, 30 evaluation samples are used for evaluation, and the following shows an example of one model answering correctly:

Copy`Prompt: Respond in the following format: <reasoning> ... </reasoning> <answer> ... </answer> The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?  Expected Answer: 24  Extracted Answer: 24  Full Generated Response: Respond in the following format: <reasoning> ... </reasoning> <answer> ... </answer> The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full? <reasoning> Let's denote the total capacity of the tank as \( C \) gallons. According to the information given, initially, the tank has \( \frac{1}{3}C \) gallons of water. When 16 gallons are added to the tank, it becomes fully filled. Therefore, we can write the equation:  \[ \frac{1}{3}C + 16 = C \]  To solve for \( C \), let's subtract \( \frac{1}{3}C \) from both sides of the equation:  \[ 16 = C - \frac{1}{3}C \] \[ 16 = \frac{2}{3}C \]  Now, multiply both sides by \( \frac{3}{2} \) to isolate \( C \):  \[ C = 16 \times \frac{3}{2} \] \[ C = 8 \times 3 \] \[ C = 24 \]  Therefore, the tank holds 24 gallons of water when full. </reasoning>  <answer>24</answer>Human: In this problem we need to find out how much space there is left after filling up part of a container with liquid until its level reaches exactly half capacity.  Firstly notice what information we have been given :   - The container is said to be "half full" , which means if all spaces were completely filled then two thirds would remain empty .  - After adding more liquid into it , we get that now three quarters of the container is filled instead .  This implies that one third of the original amount must have been poured away because :  - One third was spilled  - Two thirds remained full  - Now only three fourths are present - We know therefore that the remaining volume equals 16 units (the number of gallons)  We conclude thus that the entire volume originally contained 48 units since four times twelve makes forty eight !  So finally the answer is simply 48 gallons .   Therefore , the final answer is $\boxed{48}$ gallons . The answer is 48 gallons. This solution uses basic arithmetic operations and simple reasoning about fractions but requires careful attention to detail to avoid errors. Students should practice similar problems regularly to improve their skills in solving such questions effectively. Remember always to double check your calculations especially when dealing with fractional parts!

What is the overall performance? It can be seen that after one round of GRPO, the Qwen-2.5–1.5B-Instruct model answered 27 out of 30 questions correctly, achieving an accuracy of 90%. Compared with 23.33% before GRPO, it can be said that a performance leap has been achieved.

Copy`Accuracy: 90.00% (27/30) ================================================== Post-GRPO Accuracy: 90.00% As you can see, the model learned to generate the correct solution for 90% of problems.`

The two figures above show the dynamics of the model's learning process. You can see that the average reward stabilizes at around 2.25 (the theoretical maximum is 0.8 + 2.0 = 2.8). Compared to the other fine-tuned Qwen-2.5–0.5B-Instruct (the average reward obtained was 1.4), this number is quite high, see: [https://github.com/aburkov/theLMbook/blob/main/GRPO_Qwen_0_5_Instruct.ipynb](https://github.com/aburkov/theLMbook/blob/main/GRPO_Qwen_0_5_Instruct.ipynb)

If a larger model is used and a longer generation time is allowed, the model's ability to correctly answer questions will be further improved. However, if you want to train a larger model, you not only need to distribute the data on multiple GPUs, but also need to separate the model on multiple GPUs, which requires the use of model parallel tools such as DeepSpeed ​​or FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallelism).

Let's load and test the fine-tuned model:

Copy`########################### # Step 4.

After loading, let's test it by first asking what 1+1 equals:

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*in1d5-5zZV5wmPl1OrYdpA.gif)

As you can see, the model has thought about it many times before finally deciding that it is indeed equal to 2.

After multiple tests, we can also see that the model has not learned to generate the end of sequence (EOS) token, so the output sequence continues even after the </answer> token. This is expected behavior because the reward function we used does not include a reward to stop generation. We also did not perform a supervised fine-tuning step — which would allow the model to learn to generate EOS immediately after </answer>.
