### Textual Entailment (Natural Language Inference - NLI)

- Objective: Determine the relationship between a premise (PP) and a hypothesis (HH) from three categories:
    
    1. **Entailment:** PP guarantees HH.
    2. **Contradiction:** PP refutes HH.
    3. **Neutral:** PP neither confirms nor refutes HH.
- **Significance:** Essential for NLP tasks like question answering (validating answers), information retrieval (ensuring document relevance), information extraction (consistency checks), and machine translation evaluation (maintaining semantic accuracy).
    
- Textual entailment, often referred to as natural language inference (NLI), is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves determining the relationship between two pieces of text, a premise, and a hypothesis. The task is to decide whether the hypothesis is entailed (can be logically inferred), contradicted, or is neutral with respect to the premise.
    

### Definitions

- **Entailment:** If the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis.
    - _Premise:_ The cat is sleeping.
    - _Hypothesis:_ There is a cat.
    - _Relationship:_ Entailment
- **Contradiction:** If the truth of the premise guarantees the hypothesis is false.
    - _Premise:_ The cat is sleeping.
    - _Hypothesis:_ The cat is playing.
    - _Relationship:_ Contradiction
- **Neutral:** If the truth of the premise neither guarantees the truth nor the falsehood of the hypothesis.
    - _Premise:_ The cat is sleeping.
    - _Hypothesis:_ The cat is dreaming.
    - _Relationship:_ Neutral

### Importance

- Textual entailment plays a crucial role in many NLP applications, including:

1. **Question Answering:** To verify if the answer obtained from a source truly addresses the posed question.
2. **Information Retrieval:** To ensure the retrieved documents are relevant to the search query.
3. **Information Extraction:** To verify if the extracted pieces of information are consistent with the source content.
4. **Machine Translation Evaluation:** To determine if the translated content retains the meaning of the original.

### Approaches

1. **Feature-based Models:**
    - Utilize hand-crafted features: lexical overlaps, syntactic structures (parse tree comparisons), and semantic alignments (wordnet-based similarity).
    - Employ techniques like TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and semantic role labeling.
2. **Deep Learning Models:**
    - RNNs (LSTMs & GRUs): Sequential models capturing context in texts, e.g., decomposable attention model uses LSTM representations for alignment-based entailment.
    - Transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa):
        - Architecture: Multiple self-attention layers for capturing contextual information.
        - Pre-training: On large corpora with masked language modeling tasks.
        - Fine-tuning: On specific NLI datasets for optimal results. BERT, for instance, uses [CLS] token’s representation for sentence pair classification after fine-tuning.
3. **Attention Mechanisms:**
    - Weighting scheme allowing models to focus on relevant parts of the text.
    - Especially efficient in transformers where self-attention enables understanding intra-textual relationships and dependencies.

### Datasets

1. **SNLI:** Over 500,000 sentence pairs, crowdsourced with entailment annotations.
2. **MultiNLI:** Enhances SNLI by covering diverse textual genres.
3. **RTE Challenge Sets:** Annual datasets focusing on specific entailment challenges.
