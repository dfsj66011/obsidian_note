## Overview

- The monitoring of machine learning models refers to the ways we track and understand our model performance in production from both a data science and operational perspective. Inadequate monitoring can lead to incorrect models left unchecked in production, stale models that stop adding business value, or subtle bugs in models that appear over time and never get caught. When ML is at the core of your business, a failure to catch these sorts of bugs can be a bankruptcy-inducing event - particularly if your company operates in a regulated environment.
- Martin Fowler has popularized the concept of [Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html), and the diagram below [(source)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html) for this concept offers a useful visual guide to the ML lifecycle and where monitoring comes into play:

## Best Practices for LLM Training

- Let’s start off by talking about some of the best practices for LLM training by looking at the key aspects we should look out for.
- Choosing the right hardware for training LLMs: LLMs require significant compute resources to train, and choosing the right hardware can have a big impact on the training time and cost. GPUs, TPUs, and cloud-based computing are common choices for LLM training.
- Preprocessing data and optimizing training data pipeline: Data preprocessing is an important step in LLM training, as it can affect the quality and performance of the model. Preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, normalization, and cleaning can improve the quality of the training data. Optimizing the training data pipeline can also speed up the training process and reduce costs.
- Selecting the right training algorithm and hyperparameters: LLMs can be trained using a variety of algorithms, such as LSTM, Transformer, and BERT, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Selecting the right algorithm and hyperparameters is critical for achieving good performance and avoiding overfitting or underfitting.
- Monitoring and tracking LLM training progress: Monitoring the training progress is important to ensure that the model is converging and not getting stuck in local minima. Tracking metrics such as loss, accuracy, and perplexity can help identify issues early and improve the training process.

## Managing LLM Models

- Now we will delve a bit deeper into the best practices of managing large language models from saving and loading, to versioning, to reproducibility.
