## 一、概述

- LLMs 和 VLMs 在多种基准测试中进行评估，这些测试考察它们在语言理解、推理、编程和多媒体理解（针对 VLMs）的能力。
- 这些基准测试对于 AI 模型的发展至关重要，因为它们提供了标准化的挑战，有助于识别模型的优劣势，推动未来的改进。
- 本文简要介绍了这些基准测试、数据集的属性以及相关论文。


## 二、LLMs

### 2.1 通用基准

* GLUE（通用语言理解评估）：包含九个任务的集合，包括问答和文本蕴涵，旨在评估一般的语言理解能力。涵盖来自网络文本、小说和非小说的多样化文本类型，要求模型处理多种语言风格和复杂性。
* SuperGLUE：GLUE 的更具挑战性的版本，旨在推动语言模型达到极限，包括多个领域的复杂推理任务，强调推断、逻辑和常识。
* MMLU（大规模多任务语言理解）：涵盖 57 个任务，涉及人文学科、STEM 和社会科学等领域，需要广泛和专业的知识。任务形式多样，包括选择题和开放式问题，确保对语言智能的全面评估。
* MMLU-Pro（大规模多任务语言理解专业版）：稳健且具有挑战性的数据集，旨在严格评估大型语言模型的能力。包含来自各个学科的 12,000 个复杂问题，通过将选项从 4 个增加到 10 个，增强了评估的复杂性和模型的稳健性，使随机猜测不再有效。与原始 MMLU 的知识驱动问题不同，MMLU-Pro 专注于更困难的基于推理的问题，其中链式思维（CoT）的结果可以比困惑度（PPL）高 20%。这种增加的难度使模型表现更加一致，例如 Llama-2-7B 的方差在 1% 以内，而原始 MMLU 中为 4-5%。
* BIG-bench（超越模仿游戏基准）：包含200多个多样化任务，包括算术、常识推理、语言理解等。通过包含简单和高度复杂的任务，旨在推动当前大型语言模型能力的极限。
* BIG-bench Hard：包含 BIG-bench 套件中最难的任务，需要高级推理、问题解决和深刻理解。旨在评估模型在比典型基准难度更大的任务上的表现。

#### 2.1.2 推理

* HellaSwag：要求模型从四个选项中选择最合理的延续，需要对日常活动和场景的细致理解。它包含经过对抗性筛选的例子，以确保难度并最大限度地减少预训练中的数据泄漏。

- **Description:** Evaluates models’ ability to answer 448 multiple-choice questions written by domain experts in biology, physics, and chemistry.
- **Dataset Attributes:** Includes high-quality and extremely difficult questions: experts who have or are pursuing PhDs in the corresponding domains reach 65% accuracy (74% when discounting clear mistakes the experts identified in retrospect), while highly skilled non-expert validators only reach 34% accuracy, despite spending on average over 30 minutes with unrestricted access to the web (i.e., the questions are “Google-proof”).
- **Reference:** [“GPQA: A Benchmark for General Purpose Question Answering”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12022).

##### FLASH (Fine-grained Language Agent Self-Check Harness)

- **Description:** FLASH is a benchmark designed to evaluate the self-checking abilities of large language models. It assesses how well models can reason through, verify, and correct their own outputs across diverse scenarios and task types.
- **Dataset Attributes:** Comprises 1,060 instances spanning 32 task types and 5 self-checking task variants (e.g., verification, correction, and explanation of mistakes). Tasks are derived from 20 existing datasets, and examples are filtered to ensure they contain reasoning steps with clear mistakes. FLASH emphasizes multi-step reasoning, logical flow, and the ability to detect and amend faulty outputs.
- **Reference:** [“FLASH: A Fine-grained Language Agent Self-check Harness”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01142).

#### Contextual Comprehension

##### LAMBADA

- **Description:** Focuses on predicting the last word of a passage, requiring a deep understanding of the context.
- **Dataset Attributes:** Passages where the last word requires significant contextual understanding, testing language models’ deep comprehension. The passages are drawn from novels and require broad contextual reasoning to accurately predict the final word.
- **Reference:** [“The LAMBADA dataset: Word prediction requiring a broad discourse context”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06031).

##### BoolQ
