### 一、概述

- 在 AI 文本生成中，“幻觉”是指 AI 模型生成的文本虽然在语法上正确且看似合理，但并未基于给定输入，甚至可能与事实不符。这一问题在像 GPT-3 这样的系统中尤为常见，生成的细节可能偏离甚至与输入相矛盾。
- 理解幻觉产生的原因可以追溯到多个方面：
  1. *训练数据不足：* 如果模型在训练中没有接触到多样化的数据，可能无法建立输入与合适输出之间的准确关联，导致幻觉内容。
  2. *模型过拟合：* 对训练数据的过拟合会导致模型生成的输出与训练集相似，但与新输入不匹配。
  3. *监督不足：* 缺乏适当的指导，模型可能过于依赖自身的内部逻辑，导致输出看似“幻觉”。
  4. *知识截止：* 像 ChatGPT 这样的 LLMs 有知识截止日期，因此对该日期之后的信息不了解，可能会无意中提供过时的信息。
- AI 生成内容中的幻觉现象强调了在实际应用中提高 AI 系统可靠性的持续改进需求。然而，它也为人工智能和自然语言处理领域的创新研究打开了大门。
- 本文探讨了在模型流程的各个阶段对抗和减轻幻觉影响的各种策略。

### 二、训练阶段缓解方法

#### 2.1 RLHF

- 类似于“人类参与”的方法，RLHF 通过人类反馈来减少幻觉。通过收集数据，让人类根据质量对模型生成的不同响应进行排名，模型可以学习调整其输出，以更好地符合人类的期望。
- 使用 RLHF 来减少幻觉的理念是，人类可以对模型响应的准确性和相关性提供反馈。通过在训练过程中整合这些反馈，模型可以学习区分准确和不准确的信息，从而减少幻觉的可能性。此外，RLHF 还可以帮助模型理解其行为的后果，提高生成相关和真实响应的能力。

### 三、Prompting 缓解方法

#### 3.1 RAG

- RAG 通过在生成过程中为 LLMs 提供额外的上下文信息，帮助消除幻觉。当 LLM 基于其训练数据中学到的模式生成响应，而不是依赖实际知识时，就会出现幻觉。这通常发生在模型缺乏特定领域信息或难以识别自身知识边界时。
- RAG 通过将外部知识源整合到生成过程中来解决这一问题。它使 LLM 能够从外部数据库中获取最新或特定上下文的数据，并在生成响应时提供给模型。通过这样做，RAG 为提示注入了更多上下文，帮助 LLM 更好地理解主题，减少幻觉的可能性。
- 此外，RAG 可以与高级提示工程技术（如向量数据库）结合使用，以进一步提高 LLMs 的性能。通过利用这些方法，公司可以有效地使用内部或第三方数据，确保生成的响应不仅连贯，而且在事实层面上是正确的。
- 总体而言，RAG 是一种减轻 LLMs 幻觉的有效方法，通过补充外部知识源，提高其生成更可靠和信息丰富答案的能力。

#### 3.2 上下文提示

- 马里兰大学的研究 [Trapping LLM “Hallucinations” Using Tagged Context Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06085.pdf#:~:text=We%20observed%20a%20significant%20reduction,in%20responses%20with%2098.88%25%20effectiveness.) 使用了一种在上下文提示中标记来源的技术，以减少幻觉。
  - 提供给 LLM 的问题上下文包括维基百科文章、书籍章节的摘要等。
  - 这些上下文段落通过在句末插入唯一标识符（如“(source 1234)”或“(source 4567)”）进行标记。
  - 例如：
    - “巴黎是法国的首都。(source 1234)”
    - “法国位于西欧。(source 4567)”
  - 这些来源标签是对应原始上下文段落中特定句子的唯一编号
  - 在向 LLM 提供问题和标记的上下文时，该方法还附加了指令：“在答案中提供细节并包含来源”
  - 结果是，LLM 被引导在生成响应时参考这些标记的来源。
  - 标签提供了一种验证 LLM 响应是否基于给定上下文的方式。
  - 如果响应包含匹配的来源标签，表明 LLM 依赖提供的上下文而非产生幻觉。
  - 作者发现，与没有上下文相比，这种标记技术将幻觉响应减少了约 99%。

#### 3.3 [验证链](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11495.pdf)

- 这篇由 Meta AI 撰写的论文提出了 CoVe（验证链）以减少幻觉。CoVe 通过生成一些验证问题并执行这些问题来检查一致性。以下是概念展示：![|500](https://aman.ai/primers/ai/assets/hallucination/hallu.png)
- CoVe在生成初始响应后经过多个步骤：
	1. 生成查询的基础响应，这可能包含不准确或幻觉。
	2. 规划验证—— LLM 生成一组验证问题以核实其工作。
	3. 执行验证—— LLM 独立回答验证问题。
	4. 生成最终响应 —— 根据验证结果修订初始响应。

- 验证问题通常比长段落中的事实更准确。
    
- 不同的 CoVe 变体控制验证期间的注意力以避免重复错误信息：
    
    1. 联合 CoVe：
        - 用单个提示进行问题规划和回答。
        - 单个提示包含查询、基础响应、验证问题和答案。
        - 注意力可以集中在包括可能不正确的基础响应的所有上下文上。
        - 在回答问题时容易重复相同的幻觉。
    2. 两步 CoVe：
        - 基于基础响应单独规划问题。
        - 单独提示回答问题，不带基础响应上下文。
        - 避免直接关注可能不正确的基础。
        - 但注意力仍可跨所有问题答案。
    3. 分解 CoVe：
        - 每个问题完全独立回答。
        - 每个验证问题都有完全独立的提示。
        - 不关注任何其他上下文，包括基础响应。
        - 避免问题间的干扰。
        - 对重复错误信息最具鲁棒性。
    4. 分解+修订：
        - 明确交叉检查问答与原始事实。
        - 额外提示明确交叉检查问答与原始事实。
        - 注意力集中在原始事实和问答上。
        - 标记最终响应的不一致之处。
- 注意，这些方法不是并行使用的，而是独立测试的同一框架的不同变体。分解+修订是在分解版本基础上构建的。
    
- 关键发现是，通过分解注意力进行更独立的推理，避免依赖和重复原始响应中的潜在幻觉。这在减少错误信息方面取得了更高的收益。
    
- 总之，CoVe 让模型通过规划和回答重点问题来验证其生成内容，避免依赖其自身可能不正确的响应。这在多个任务中有效减少了幻觉。

### 四、模型缓解方法

#### 4.1 [DoLa: 通过对比层解码提升大型语言模型的事实性](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03883.pdf)

- 微软的研究引入了一种称为“对比层解码”（DoLa）的新方法，旨在减少 LLMs 中的幻觉现象，无需额外训练或检索。该技术基于这样一种理解：LLMs 中的事实知识主要编码在 transformer 架构的后期或更成熟的层中。
- 在文本生成过程中，DoLa 不依赖于静态选择的早期层（transformer 架构中的前期层）进行对比，而是为每个标记的解码动态选择合适的早期层。DoLa 通过计算早期层的输出分布与成熟层（架构中的最终层）的输出分布之间的 Jensen-Shannon 散度（JSD）来确定这一层。JSD 用于测量两个概率分布之间的不相似性。其基本逻辑是选择一个与成熟层对比时 JSD 最大的早期层，有效地最大化这些层中包含的事实知识和语言倾向之间的对比。

- 功能细节：
  1. 对于每个被解码的标记，DoLa 动态选择一个早期层，通过识别哪个层的输出分布与成熟层的分布最为不同（JSD 最大）。
  2. 较高的 JSD 表示两个层中编码的事实和语言内容之间的差异更加明显。
  3. 早期层体现更基础的语言模式，而成熟层更具代表性地包含事实知识。
  4. DoLa 通过对比成熟层与选择的早期层的 logit 输出来计算下一个标记的概率分布，具体而言，这涉及从成熟层的 log 概率中减去早期层的 log 概率。
  5. 结果生成的概率分布强调了事实信息，同时削弱了单纯的语言模式。

- 这种方法很灵活。对于相对简单的标记，层间分布相似（JSD 较低），可能选择早期层作为早期层。相反，对于需要复杂现实世界知识的标记，可能选择更高的早期层以增强与成熟层的对比。
- 实验表明，当 DoLa 在多项选择问答、开放式问答和文本生成等各种任务上进行测试时，该方法在事实性和真实性方面显示出显著改善，超越了传统解码和其他对比解码技术。此外，DoLa 在推理阶段仅引入了最小的计算开销，使其成为一种轻量级但有效的方法。

- 本质上，DoLa 提供了一种动态对比 transformer 层中编码的知识的方法，以减少幻觉，其能够自适应地为每个标记选择合适的早期层是其有效性的关键。

- DoLa 所采用的方法通过对比“早期”层和“成熟”层的输出。成熟层通常是模型的最终层，被认为编码了更多的事实知识，而早期层则包含更多基础语言模式。

- 动态选择早期层（而非成熟层）的原因在于方法的目标：

  1. *对比机制*：通过对比两个层（早期和成熟）的输出，DoLa 旨在放大成熟层中编码的事实信息，同时弱化早期层中的基础语言模式。
  2. *动态适应性*：成熟层保持一致（因为它始终是最终层），动态选择早期层提供了适应性。对于不同的标记或上下文，成熟层与特定早期层之间的区别可能更加明显，从而导致更高的 JSD。通过为不同标记选择不同的早期层，DoLa 可以更好地最大化这种区别。
  3. *突出事实信息*：成熟层的输出已经被期望更具事实性。选择早期层的价值在于与成熟层的对比。这进一步强调了成熟层输出中的事实内容。
  4. *灵活性*：早期层的可能输出范围提供了一个语言模式的光谱。通过选择这个光谱，DoLa可以根据上下文自适应地对比不同类型的语言模式与成熟层中的事实知识。

- 本质上，成熟层作为一个一致的参考点，而早期层的选择允许模型自适应地强调事实内容而不是语言模式，从而减少幻觉并提高生成内容的事实准确性。

### 五、生成后验证

通过人类验证提示来减少幻觉现象。

#### 5.1 [通过交互式问题-知识对齐减轻语言模型幻觉](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13669.pdf)

- MixAlign 是一个创新框架，旨在促进用户与知识库之间的无缝互动。其核心优势在于确保用户查询与知识库中存储的信息精确对齐。MixAlign 设计的关键在于战略性地引入人类参与，以减轻幻觉现象。
- 在接收到用户查询后，MixAlign 利用语言模型优化该查询，确保其与知识库模式中的属性紧密匹配。使用优化后的查询，系统提取相关的证据段落。然而，当面对多个可能含糊的候选响应时，MixAlign 启动其以人为中心的机制。
- 在此阶段，MixAlign 识别出将候选项区分开的最显著属性。利用这一属性，语言模型制定一个有针对性的澄清问题。例如，如果“季节”成为区分属性，可能会提出“您指的是哪个季节？”这样的问题。用户的后续反馈可以使查询更加精确，消除候选项之间的模糊性。
- 这种以人类见解为关键的协作互动随后被重新整合回系统中。在这种精细对齐的支持下，语言模型能够生成一个更为细致的最终响应。
- 本质上，MixAlign 将自动化过程与及时的人类干预结合在一起，通过这样做，它在问题出现之初就解决了潜在的模糊性，从而克服了传统检索增强生成系统中的主要障碍。

![|300](https://aman.ai/primers/ai/assets/hallucination/2.png)

#### 5.2 人类参与

- 总体而言，利用人工审核来验证大型语言模型的输出可以帮助减轻幻觉的影响，并提高生成文本的整体质量和可靠性。

### 六、相关论文

### [FACTSCORE: Fine-grained Atomic Evaluation of Factual Precision in Long Form Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14251)

- This paper by Min et al. from UW, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Allen Institute for AI, and Meta AI focuses on evaluating the factual accuracy of long-form text generated by large language models (LMs).
- The paper introduces FACTSCORE, a novel evaluation method that measures the factual precision of text generated by LMs. It breaks down a generation into atomic facts and calculates the percentage of these facts supported by a reliable knowledge source. This method is particularly necessary since text generations often contain a mix of supported and unsupported information, making binary judgments of quality inadequate.
- FACTSCORE addresses two key ideas: using atomic facts as units for evaluation and assessing factual precision based on a specific knowledge source. It defines an atomic fact as a short sentence containing a single piece of information. This approach allows for a more fine-grained evaluation of factual precision than previous methods. The paper uses people biographies as a basis for evaluation due to their objective nature and covers diverse nationalities, professions, and rarity levels.
- The following image from the paper shows an overview of FACTSCORE, a fraction of atomic facts (pieces of information) supported by a given knowledge source. FACTSCORE allows a more fine-grained evaluation of factual precision, e.g., in the figure, the top model gets a score of 66.7% and the bottom model gets 10.0%, whereas prior work would assign 0.0 to both. FACTSCORE can either be based on human evaluation, or be automated, which allows evaluation of a large set of LMs with no human efforts.

![](https://aman.ai/images/papers/FACTSCORE.jpg)

- Their automated estimator of FACTSCORE first breaks a generation into a series of atomic facts and then validates each against the given knowledge source. They use LLAMA 7B trained on Super Natural Instructions and ChatGPT as an LMEVAL, and Generalizable T5-based Retrievers for passage retrieval.
- The paper evaluates three state-of-the-art commercial LMs: InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and PerplexityAI. These models struggle with factual precision errors, with FACTSCOREs of 42%, 58%, and 71%, respectively. The study highlights that the factual precision of these LMs significantly drops with the rarity of the entities discussed in the text.
- To address the time-consuming and costly nature of human evaluation, the authors propose an automated model to estimate FACTSCORE. This model decomposes text into atomic facts and validates each against a knowledge source, closely approximating FACTSCORE with less than a 2% error rate. It allows the evaluation of a large set of new LMs without manual human effort.
- The paper also showcases the application of this automated estimator by evaluating 12 recently released LMs, offering insights into their factual accuracy. This approach could have cost $65K if evaluated by humans, highlighting the cost-effectiveness of the automated method.
- Finally, the paper suggests future work to enhance FACTSCORE, including considering other aspects of factuality such as recall (coverage of factual information), improving the estimator for better approximation of factual precision, and leveraging FACTSCORE to correct model generations.
- Overall, FACTSCORE represents a significant advancement in evaluating the factual precision of text generated by LMs, providing a detailed and cost-effective method for assessing the accuracy of long-form text.

### [G-Eval: NLG Evaluation Using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634)

- The quality of texts generated by natural language generation (NLG) systems is hard to measure automatically. Conventional reference-based metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, have been shown to have relatively low correlation with human judgments, especially for tasks that require creativity and diversity. Recent studies suggest using large language models (LLMs) as reference-free metrics for NLG evaluation, which have the benefit of being applicable to new tasks that lack human references. However, these LLM-based evaluators still have lower human correspondence than medium-size neural evaluators.
- This paper by Liu et al. from presents G-Eval, a framework of using large language models with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and a form-filling paradigm, to assess the quality of NLG outputs.
- The following table from the paper illustrates the overall framework of G-Eval. We first input Task Introduction and Evaluation Criteria to the LLM, and ask it to generate a CoT of detailed Evaluation Steps. Then we use the prompt along with the generated CoT to evaluate the NLG outputs in a form-filling paradigm. Finally, we use the probability-weighted summation of the output scores as the final score.

![](https://aman.ai/images/papers/G-Eval.jpg)

- They experiment with two generation tasks, text summarization and dialogue generation. They show that G-Eval with GPT-4 as the backbone model achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.514 with human on summarization task, outperforming all previous methods by a large margin.
- They also propose preliminary analysis on the behavior of LLM-based evaluators, and highlight the potential issue of LLM-based evaluators having a bias towards the LLM-generated texts.

### [Aligning Large Multimodal Models with Factually Augmented RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14525)

- This paper by Sun et al. from UC Berkeley, CMU, UIUC, UW–Madison, UMass Amherst, MSR, MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab addresses the issue of multimodal misalignment in large multimodal models (LMMs), which can lead to hallucinations—generating textual outputs not grounded in multimodal context. To mitigate this, the authors propose adapting Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to vision-language alignment and introducing Factually Augmented RLHF (Fact-RLHF).
- The proposed method involves several key steps:
    1. **Multimodal Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: The initial stage involves fine-tuning a vision encoder and a pre-trained large language model (LLM) on an instruction-following demonstration dataset to create a supervised fine-tuned model (πSFT).
    2. **Multimodal Preference Modeling**: This stage trains a reward model to score responses based on human annotations. The reward model uses pairwise comparison data to learn to prefer less hallucinated responses. The training employs a cross-entropy loss function to adjust the model’s preferences.
    3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The policy model is fine-tuned using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to maximize the reward signal from the preference model. A KL penalty is applied to prevent over-optimization and reward hacking.
    4. **Factually Augmented RLHF (Fact-RLHF)**: To enhance the reward model, it is augmented with factual information such as image captions and ground-truth multi-choice options. This addition helps the reward model avoid being misled by hallucinations that are not grounded in the actual image content.
    5. **Enhancing Training Data**: The authors improve the training data by augmenting GPT-4-generated vision instruction data with existing high-quality human-annotated image-text pairs. This includes data from VQA-v2, A-OKVQA, and Flickr30k, converted into suitable formats for vision-language tasks.
    6. **MMHAL-BENCH**: To evaluate the proposed approach, the authors develop a new benchmark, MMHAL-BENCH, focusing on penalizing hallucinations. This benchmark covers various types of questions that often lead to hallucinations in LMMs, such as object attributes, adversarial objects, comparisons, counting, spatial relations, and environment descriptions.
- The figure below from the paper illustrates that hallucination may occur during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase of LMM training and how Factually Augmented RLHF alleviates the issue of limited capacity in the reward model which is initialized from the SFT model.

![](https://aman.ai/images/papers/Fact-RLHF.jpg)

- The implementation of Fact-RLHF shows significant improvements:
    - **Improved Alignment**: LLaVA-RLHF, the model trained with Fact-RLHF, achieves 94% of the performance level of text-only GPT-4 on the LLaVA-Bench dataset, compared to 87% by previous best methods.
    - **Reduced Hallucinations**: On MMHAL-BENCH, LLaVA-RLHF outperforms other baselines by 60%, showing a substantial reduction in hallucinated responses.
    - **Enhanced Performance**: The model also sets new performance benchmarks on MMBench and POPE datasets, demonstrating improved general capabilities and alignment with human preferences.
- Overall, the paper highlights the effectiveness of integrating factual augmentation in RLHF to address multimodal misalignment, thereby reducing hallucinations and enhancing the reliability of large multimodal models. The authors have open-sourced their code, model, and data for further research and development in this area.

## 外源性幻觉

> source: [Lil'Log # Extrinsic Hallucinations in LLMs](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/)
> 翻译：[外源性幻觉](https://1024foundation.org.cn/community/extrinsic-hallucinations-in-llms)(此处非完整原文)

大语言模型中的幻觉（Hallucination）通常指的是模型生成的不忠实、编造、不一致或无意义的内容。作为一个术语，“幻觉”已经被泛化到模型出错的情况。在本文中，我想将幻觉的问题缩小到模型输出是虚构编造的，并*没有基于所提供的上下文或由世界知识支撑*。

幻觉可以分为两种类型：

1.  *上下文幻觉***：模型输出应该与上下文中的源内容保持一致。
2.  *外源性幻觉*：模型输出应该基于预训练数据集中的知识。然而，考虑到预训练数据集的庞大规模，每次生成时检索并识别潜在冲突的成本过高。如果我们将预训练数据集视为世界知识的代理，我们实际上是在尝试确保模型输出的内容是事实，并且能够通过外部世界知识进行验证。同样重要的是，当模型不清楚某个事实时，它应当如实承认。

本文的重点在于外源性幻觉。为了避免幻觉，大语言模型需要做到（1）输出内容基于事实，（2）不知时承认自己不知道。

### 1、原因

* *预训练数据问题*：存在信息过时、缺失或不正确等问题。
* *微调新知识*：在微调阶段，引入新知识。微调所需的计算量通常较少，因此小规模微调能否可靠的让模型学到新知识备受争议。

### 2、检测


## Retrieval-Augmented Evaluation

To quantify model hallucinations, [Lee et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04624) introduced a new benchmark dataset, **FactualityPrompt**, consisting of both factual and nonfactual prompts. This dataset uses Wikipedia documents or sentences as the knowledge base for factuality grounding. The Wikipedia documents are known ground-truth from the [FEVER](https://fever.ai/dataset/fever.html) dataset, and the sentences are selected based on tf-idf or sentence embedding-based similarity.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/factuality-prompt-eval.png)

Fig. 3. The evaluation framework for the FactualityPrompt benchmark.  
(Image source: [Lee, et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04624))

Given the model continuation and paired Wikipedia text, two evaluation metrics for hallucination are considered:

1. **Hallucination NE (Named Entity) errors**: Using a pretrained entity detection model and document-level grounding, this metric measures the fraction of detected named entities that do not appear in the ground truth document.
2. **Entailment ratios**: Using a RoBERTa model fine-tuned on MNLI and sentence-level knowledge grounding, this metric calculates the fraction of generated sentences that are marked as relevant to the paired Wikipedia sentence by the entailment model.

Lower NE errors and higher entailment ratios indicate higher factuality, and both metrics are found to be correlated with human annotations. Larger models are found to perform better on this benchmark.

**FActScore** (Factual precision in Atomicity Score; [Min et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14251)) decomposes a long form generation into multiple atomic facts and validates each separately against a knowledge base like Wikipedia. Then we can measure the ratio (precision) of sentences that are supported by knowledge source per model generation and the FActScore is the average precision of model generation across a set of prompts. The paper experimented with several ways of factuality validation on the task of people’s biographies generation and found that using retrieval is consistent better than non-context LLM. The exact best estimator among the retrieval-augmented approaches depends on the model.

- Non-context LLM: Prompt LLM directly with `<atomic-fact> True or False?` without additional context.
- Retrieval→LLM: Prompt with k related passages retrieved from the knowledge source as context.
- Nonparametric probability (NP)): Compute the average likelihood of tokens in the atomic fact by a masked LM and use that to make a prediction.
- Retrieval→LLM + NP: Ensemble of two methods.

Some interesting observations on model hallucination behavior:

- Error rates are higher for rarer entities in the task of biography generation.
- Error rates are higher for facts mentioned later in the generation.
- Using retrieval to ground the model generation significantly helps reduce hallucination.

[Wei et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18802) proposed an evaluation method for checking long-form factuality in LLMs, named **SAFE** (Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator; [code](https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality/tree/main/eval/safe)). The main difference compared to FActScore is that for each self-contained, atomic fact, SAFE uses a language model as an agent to iteratively issue Google Search queries in a multi-step process and reason about whether the search results support or do not support the fact. In each step, the agent generates a search query based on a given fact to check, as well as previously obtained search results. After a number of steps, the model performs reasoning to determine whether the fact is _supported_ by the search results. According to the experiments, SAFE approach works better than human annotators despite of 20x cheaper: 72% agreement rate with humans and 76% win rate over humans when they disagree.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/SAFE-overview.png)

Fig. 4. Overview of SAFE for factuality evaluation of long-form LLM generation. (Image source: [Wei et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18802))

The SAFE evaluation metric is **F1 @ K**. The motivation is that model response for **long**-form factuality should ideally hit both precision and recall, as the response should be both

- _factual_ : measured by precision, the percentage of supported facts among all facts in the entire response.
- _long_ : measured by recall, the percentage of provided facts among all relevant facts that should appear in the response. Therefore we want to consider the number of supported facts up to K.

Given the model response y, the metric **F1 @ K** is defined as:

S(y)=the number of supported factsN(y)=the number of not-supported factsPrec(y)=S(y)S(y)+N(y),RK(y)=min(S(y)K,1)F1@K={2Prec(y)RK(y)Prec(y)+RK(y)if S(y)>00,if S(y)=0

Long-form factuality performance, measured in F1@K, for a list of mainstream models, using 250 random prompts from LongFact-Objects from [LongFact](https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality/tree/main/longfact) benchmark. (Image source: [Wei et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18802))

**FacTool** ([Chern et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13528)) follows a standard fact checking workflow. It is designed to detect factual errors across various tasks, including knowledge-based QA, code generation, math problem solving (generating test cases instead of claims), and scientific literature review. It follows

1. Claim extraction: Extract all verifiable claims by prompting LLMs.
2. Query generation: Convert each claim to a list of queries suitable for external tools, such as search engine query, unit test cases, code snippets, and paper titles.
3. Tool querying & evidence collection: Query external tools like search engine, code interpreter, Google scholar and get back results.
4. Agreement verification: Assign each claim a binary factuality label based on the level of support from evidence from external tools.

## Sampling-Based Detection

**SelfCheckGPT** ([Manakul et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896)) relies on consistency check on factuality mistakes against multiple samples from a black-box LLM. Considering that grey-box fact checking measurement needs access to token-level logprob of LLMs, SelfCheckGPT only requires samples with no dependency on external knowledge base, so black-box access is sufficient and no external knowledge base is needed.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/SelfCheckGPT.png)

Fig. 7. Overview of SelfCheckGPT. (Image source: [Manakul et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896))

The method works with different metrics to measure the consistency between the model response and each of the other stochastic model samples, including BERTScore, NLI, prompting (asking yes/no), etc. SelfCheckGPT with prompting seems to work out the best, when experimenting on GPT-3 generated WikiBio passages.

## Calibration of Unknown Knowledge

Prompting the model to generate responses to questions that are unanswerable or unknown could trigger hallucination. TruthfulQA ([Lin et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958)) and SelfAware ([Yin et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18153)) are two benchmarks to measure how well model can generate truthful responses in such cases, while the former is adversarially constructed to emphasize human falsehoods and the latter contains questions unanswerable due to their nature. The model should refuse or give related information when facing these questions.

Testing questions in [**TruthfulQA**](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA) ([Lin et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958)) are crafted _adversarially_ according to common misconceptions or mistakes by humans. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 topics including health, law, finance and politics. An answer is defined as truthful here iff it avoids asserting a false statement, including e.g. refusal, irrelevant truthful answers. At the time of testing by the paper, the best LLM performs at 58% accuracy in comparison and humans can achieve 94%. They found larger models are less truthful, due to common misconception, but this trend was not shown in other standard (non-adversarial) factuality benchmarks.

Examples of false answers from GPT-3 on TruthfulQA:

```

[Yin et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18153) studies the concept of _self-knowledge_, referring to whether language models know what they know or don’t know. **SelfAware**, containing 1,032 unanswerable questions across five categories and 2,337 answerable questions. Unanswerable questions are sourced from online forums with human annotations while answerable questions are sourced from SQuAD, HotpotQA and TriviaQA based on text similarity with unanswerable questions. A question may be unanswerable due to various reasons, such as no scientific consensus, imaginations of the future, completely subjective, philosophical reasons that may yield multiple responses, etc. Considering separating answerable vs unanswerable questions as a binary classification task, we can measure F1-score or accuracy and the experiments showed that larger models can do better at this task.

Another way to assess the model’s awareness of unknown knowledge is to measure the model’s output uncertainty. When a question is in-between known and unknown, the model is expected to demonstrate the right level of confidence.

The experiment by [Kadavath et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05221) showed that LLMs are shown to be well calibrated in their estimation probabilities of answer correctness on diverse multiple choice questions in a format with visible lettered answer options (MMLU, TruthfulQA, QuALITY, LogiQA), meaning that the predicted probability coincides with the frequency of that answer being true. RLHF fine-tuning makes the model poorly calibrated, but higher sampling temperature leads to better calibration results.

[Lin et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14334) used the [CalibratedMath](https://github.com/sylinrl/CalibratedMath) suite of tasks. _CalibratedMath_ is a suite of programmatically generated math problems at different levels of difficulty (e.g. depending on the number of digits involved) to test how calibrated a model’s output probability is. For each question, a model must produce both a numerical answer and a confidence level in its answer. Three types of probabilities are considered:

1. Verbalized number or word (e.g. “lowest”, “low”, “medium”, “high”, “highest”), such as `"Confidence: 60% / Medium"`.
2. Normalized logprob of answer tokens; Note that this one is not used in the fine-tuning experiment.
3. Logprob of an indirect `"True/False"` token after the raw answer. Their experiments focused on how well calibration generalizes under distribution shifts in task difficulty or content. Each fine-tuning datapoint is a question, the model’s answer (possibly incorrect), and a calibrated confidence. Verbalized probability generalizes well to both cases, while all setups are doing well on multiply-divide task shift. Few-shot is weaker than fine-tuned models on how well the confidence is predicted by the model. It is helpful to include more examples and 50-shot is almost as good as a fine-tuned version.

## Indirect Query

[Agrawal et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18248) specifically investigated the case of hallucinated references in LLM generation, including fabricated books, articles, and paper titles. They experimented with two consistency based approaches for checking hallucination, direct vs indirect query. Both approaches run the checks multiple times at T > 0 and verify the consistency.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/direct-vs-indirect-query.png)

Fig. 11. Direct vs indirect query for checking hallucination of reference generation. (Image source: [Agrawal et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18248))

_Direct query_ asks the model to judge whether a generated reference exists. **Indirect query** instead asks for auxiliary details—who are the authors—for the generated reference; e.g. If we want to check `"Is the following paper real?"`, we can check `"Who are the author of the paper?"` Hypothesis is that the likelihood of multiple generations agreeing on the same authors for a hallucinated reference would be smaller than the likelihood of multiple responses to an direct query indicating that the reference exists. Experiments showed that indirect query approach works better and larger model are more capable and can hallucinate less.

# Anti-Hallucination Methods

Let’s review a set of methods to improve factuality of LLMs, ranging from retrieval of external knowledge base, special sampling methods to alignment fine-tuning. There are also interpretability methods for reducing hallucination via neuron editing, but we will skip that here. I may write about interpretability in a separate post later.

## RAG → Edits and Attribution

[RAG (Retrieval-augmented Generation)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2020-10-29-odqa/#RAG) is a very common approach to provide grounding information, that is to retrieve relevant documents and then generate with related documents as extra context.

**RARR** (“Retrofit Attribution using Research and Revision”; [Gao et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08726)) is a framework of retroactively enabling LLMs to support attributions to external evidence via _Editing for Attribution_. Given a model generated text x, RARR processes in two steps, outputting a revised text y and an attribution report A :

1. **Research stage**: Find related documents as evidence.
    - (1) First use a query generation model (via few-shot prompting, x→q1,…,qN) to construct a set of search queries q1,…,qN to verify all aspects of each sentence.
    - (2) Run Google search, K=5 results per query qi.
    - (3) Utilize a pretrained query-document relevance model to assign relevance scores and only retain one most relevant J=1 document ei1,…,eiJ per query qi.
2. **Revision stage**: Edit the output to correct content unsupported by evidence while preserving the original content as much as possible. Initialize the revised text y=x.
    - (1) Per (qi,eij), an agreement model (via few-shot prompting + [CoT](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/#chain-of-thought-cot), (y,q,e)→0,1) checks whether the evidence ei disagrees with the current revised text y.
    - (2) Only if a disagreement is detect, the edit model (via few-shot prompting + CoT, (y,q,e)→ new y) outputs a new version of y that aims to agree with evidence eij while otherwise minimally altering y.
    - (3) Finally only a limited number M=5 of evidence goes into the attribution report A.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/RARR.png)

Fig. 12. Illustration of RARR (Retrofit Attribution using Research and Revision). (Image source: [Gao et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08726))

When evaluating the revised text y, both attribution and preservation metrics matter.

- _Attribution_ measures how much of y can be attributed to A using AIS (Attributable to Identified Sources) scores. We can collect human annotations or use a NLI model to approximate auto-AIS score.
- _Preservation_ refers to how much y preserves the original text of x , measured as Previntent×PrevLev, where Previntent needs human annotation and PrevLev is based on the character-level Levenshtein edit distance. RARR leads to better-balanced results, especially in terms of preservation metrics, compared to two baselines.

Similar to RARR using search + editing, **FAVA** (“Factuality Verification with Augmented Knowledge”; [Mishra et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06855)) also retrieves relevant documents and then edits the model output to avoid hallucination errors. The FAVA model consists of a retriever Mret and an editor Medit.

- Given a prompt x and model output y, the top relevant documents are retrieved: d=Mret(x,y)
- An augmented output is generated by editor: y^=Medit(x,y,d)

RARR does not require training, but the editor model Medit in FAVA needs to be fine-tuned. Following a more detailed taxonomy of categorizing different types of hallucination errors, we can generate synthetic training data for Medit by inserting random errors into the model generation. Each example is a triplet (c,y,y∗) where c is the original Wikipedia paragraph as the gold context, y is LM output with errors, and y∗ is an output with error tags and correct editing.

**Rethinking with retrieval** (**RR**; [He et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00303)) methods relies on retrieval of relevant external knowledge as well, but no additional editing. Instead of utilizing a search query generation model, RR’s retrieval is based on decomposed CoT prompting. Given an input prompt Q, RR uses CoT prompting to generate multiple reasoning paths R1,…,RN at temperature > 0, where each Ri reasoning path contains an explanation Ei (i.e. reasoning portion) followed by a prediction Pi (i.e. the actual model output). The external knowledge K1,…,KM is retrieved to support each explanation. Then we select the most faithful answer P^ based on how well it fits retrieved knowledge K1,…,KM.

- _Knowledge retrieval_: RR’s experiments apply sparse retrieval BM25 against Wikipedia and then rerank by embedding cosine similarity provided by a pretrained [MPNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09297) model.
- _Faithfulness score_: The faithfulness of each reasoning path is estimated by combining entailment scores, contradiction scores, and [MPNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09297) similarities. Both entailment and contradiction scores are provided by a pre-trained NLI model.

Performance of RR (Rethinking of retrieval) in comparison with other methods on commonsense reasoning ([StrategyQA](https://allenai.org/data/strategyqa)), temporal reasoning ([TempQuestions](https://github.com/IBM/tempqa-wd)) and tabular reasoning ([INFOTABS](https://infotabs.github.io/)) benchmarks, measured by the exact match metric. (Image source: [He et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00303))

**Self-RAG** (“Self-reflective retrieval-augmented generation”; [Asai et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511)) trains a LM end-to-end to learn to reflect on its own generation by outputting both task output and intermittent special _reflection tokens_. They created a supervision dataset for a critic model and a generator model by prompting GPT-4 and then distilled that into an in-house model to reduce inference cost.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/self-RAG.png)

Fig. 15. Overview of Self-RAG framework. Guided by special tokens, Self-RAG model retrieves multiple documents in parallel and critiques its own generation to improve quality. (Image source: [Asai et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511))

Given the input prompt x, the generated output y consists of multiple segments (e.g. one segment is one sentence) y=[y1,…,yT]. There are four type of reflection tokens in total, one for retrieval and three for critique:

- `Retrieve`: decides whether to run retrieval in parallel to get a set of documents; output values: `{yes, no, continue}`.
- `IsRel`: whether the prompt x and retrieved document d relevant; output values: `{relevant, irrelevant}`.
- `IsSup` whether the output text y is supported by d; output values: `{fully supported, partially supported, no support}`.
- `IsUse`: whether the output text y is useful to x; output values: `{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`.

Self-RAG generates one segment of yt at one time. Given x and the proceeding generation y<t, the model decodes the `Retrieve` token:

1. If `Retrieve` == `no`, generate yt directly;
2. If `Retrieve` == `yes`, the model retrieves multiple passages in parallel and uses an `IsRel` token to check whether the retrieved document is relevant. If relevant, generate yt and use other critique tokens to score, rank and select the best among multiple outputs.

## Chain of Actions

Without grounding by external retrieved knowledge, we can design a process for using the model itself to do verification and revision to reduce hallucination.

[Dhuliawala et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495) proposed a method named **Chain-of-Verification** (**CoVe**) based on a chain of actions to plan and execute verification. CoVe consists of four core steps:

1. _Baseline response_: The model produces an initial draft response, named “baseline”.
2. _Plan verification_: Based on this original generation, the model designs non-templated verification questions for fact checking; can be achieved by few-shot prompting with (response, verification questions) examples.
3. _Execute verifications_: The model answers those questions independently. There are a few variants of setups,
    - (1) Joint: join with step 2, where the few-shot examples are structured as (response, verification questions, verification answers); The drawback is that the original response is in the context, so the model may repeat similar hallucination.
    - (2) 2-step: separate the verification planning and execution steps, such as the original response doesn’t impact
    - (3) Factored: each verification question is answered separately. Say, if a long-form base generation results in multiple verification questions, we would answer each question one-by-one.
    - (4) Factor+revise: adding a “cross-checking” step after factored verification execution, conditioned on both the baseline response and the verification question and answer. It detects inconsistency.
4. _Final output_: Generate the final, refined output. The output gets revised at this step if any inconsistency is discovered.

CoVe is designed this ways because using long-form chain-of-verification generation may result in repeated hallucination because the initial hallucinated response is still in the context and can be attended to during the new generation, whereas answering individual verification questions separately leads to better results than long-form generation.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/CoVe.png)

Fig. 16. Overview of Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) method, running in four key steps. (Image source: [Dhuliawala et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495))

Here are some interesting observations from the CoVe experiments:

- Instruction-tuning and [CoT](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/#chain-of-thought-cot) do not reduce hallucinations.
- Factored and 2-step CoVe improve performance and further explicit reasoning on inconsistency detection also helps (“factor+revise” approach).
- Short-form verification questions are more accurately answered than long-form queries.
- Free-form LLM-generated verification questions are better than heuristics (e.g. `Does X answer the question?`) and questions that require open-ended generation work better than yes/no questions.

**RECITE** (“Recitation-augmented generation”; [Sun et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01296)) relies on recitation as an intermediate step to improve factual correctness of model generation and reduce hallucination. The motivation is to utilize Transformer memory as an information retrieval mechanism. Within RECITE’s recite-and-answer scheme, the LLM is asked to first recite relevant information and then generate the output. Precisely, we can use few-shot in-context prompting to teach the model to generate recitation and then generate answers conditioned on recitation. Further it can be combined with self-consistency ensemble consuming multiple samples and extended to support multi-hop QA.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/RECITE.png)

Fig. 17. Comparison of direct generation, RAG and RECITE.  
(Image source: [Sun et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01296))

The generated recitation is comparable with the BM25 based retrieval model, but both have gaps with the use of ground truth passage. According to their error analysis, about 7-10% questions have the correct recitation but cannot produce the correct answer, while around 12% questions do not have the correct recitation but can be answered correctly anyway.

## Sampling Methods

[Lee, et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04624) found that [nucleus sampling](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-01-02-controllable-text-generation/#nucleus) (top-p sampling) is found to perform worse on [FactualityPrompt](https://github.com/nayeon7lee/FactualityPrompt) benchmark than greedy sampling, although it achieves better diversity and less repetition, since nucleus sampling added extra randomness. So they proposed **factual-nucleus sampling** algorithm, based on the hypothesis that sampling randomness _does more harm to factuality at the latter part of the sentence than at the beginning_. Factual-nucleus sampling is designed to _dynamically_ adapt the probability p during sampling tokens for each sentence. For the t-th token in one sentence, we have pt=max(ω,p⋅λt−1) where ω is to prevent the sampling falls back to greedy that hurts generation quality and diversity.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/factual-nucleus-sampling.png)

Fig. 18. Factual-nucleus sampling leads to be better diversity and less repetition then the standard nucleus sampling, while the hallucination error is measured in [named entity (NE) error](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/#ne-error). (Image source: [Lee et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04624))

**Inference-Time Intervention** (**ITI**; [Li et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03341)) investigated whether certain attention heads are more correlated with factuality by fitting a linear probe on the activations in each layer to discriminate between truthful vs false outputs. They found for many heads, the probes cannot do better than random, while some show strong performance. After identifying a sparse set of attention heads with high linear probing accuracy for truthfulness, at inference time ITI shifts activations of top K selected attention heads along the “truthful” direction.

Fig. 19. Illustration of how activation is shifted on selected attention heads towards more truthfulness. (Image source: [Li et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03341))

## Fine-tuning for Factuality

[Lee, et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04624) proposed two ideas for factuality-enhanced training:

- `TopicPrefix` is introduced into training for better awareness of facts: Append topic (i.e. wikipedia document title) in front of each sentence in this document.
- Sentence completion loss as training objective: update the training loss to focus on the later part of the sentence where they hypothesize that the later part of a sentence contains more factual knowledge. The implementation is quite simple, deciding a pivot t, and all the tokens before the t-th token are all applied zero-masking. In their experiment, the best pivot t is selected as 0.5 x the sentence length.

[Lin et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01525) proposed to do run SFT + [RLHF](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-01-02-controllable-text-generation/#rl-fine-tuning-with-human-preferences) alignment training with special focus on factuality, named **FLAME** (“Factuality-Aware Alignment”).

- SFT stage (Factuality-aware SFT): The goal is to generate training data that is more factual (measured by FActScore) than the model’s own generation.
- RLHF stage (Factuality-aware DPO): Two approaches are tested and the method (1) turns out pretty bad, while (2) works out ok, likely due to (1) trying to distill new knowledge into the model without enough training. There is [evidence](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/#fine-tuning-new-knowledge) that fine-tuning new knowledge might cause hallucination and the supervision from RAG contains information unknown to the LLM.
    - (1) Use the RAG data sample as positive and the original model generation as negative as RM data.
    - (2) Use FActScore as the reward signal on factuality.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/FLAME.png)

To avoid accidentally distilling unknown knowledge into the model during alignment training, they suggested using the model generated responses to form SFT / DPO datasets.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/FLAME-results.png)

Fig. 21. Performance of SFT and DPO runs, with and without factuality-aware setup, on the task of biography generation. Helpfulness is measured by models' win rate over our baseline SFT + DPO on Alpaca Eval. Note that RLHF makes factuality worse, because human feedback often prefers longer, more detailed answers, which are not necessarily more factual. (Image source: [Lin et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01525))

**Factuality tuning** ([Tian & Mitchell et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08401)) also relies on fine-tuning language models for better factuality. They experimented with different ways of truthfulness estimation of atomic claims in each model sample and then run DPO

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/factuality-estimation.png)

Fig. 22. Illustration of factuality estimation process. (Image source: [Tian & Mitchell et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08401))

Process of factuality tuning:

1. Sample pairs of model completions for a given set of prompts (e.g `"Write a bio of Yo-Yo Ma"`)
2. Annotate them with truthfulness based on two methods without human involved:
    - Reference-based: check whether external knowledge base supports the model statement, similar to the above section on [retrieval-based hallucination evaluation](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/#retrieval-augmented-evaluation).
        - (a) Extract a list of atomic claims;
        - (b) Find wikipedia reference;
        - (c) Use a small NLI fine-tuned model to check whether the reference text supports the atomic claim.
    - Reference-free: use the model’s own confidence as a proxy of its truthfulness, similar to the [indirect query](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/#indirect-query) approach.
        - (a) Convert each claim into a corresponding question / need careful rephrase to ensure the question is unambiguous; using few-shot prompting;
        - (b) Sample multiple times from the model to answer that question;
        - (c) Compute the aggregated score / use string match or ask GPT to judge whether two answers are semantically equivalent.
3. Construct a training dataset by generating multiple samples from the model and assign preference based on truthfulness scores. Then we fine-tune the model with DPO on this dataset.

## Fine-tuning for Attribution

Assigning attribution in the model outputs when generating conditions on search results is a good way to reduce hallucination. There is a branch of work to train LLMs to better consume retrieved content and assign high-quality attributions.

**WebGPT** ([Nakano, et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09332)) combines web search for document retrieval with a fine-tuned GPT model, aiming to answer long-form questions to reduce hallucination and achieve better factual accuracy. The model interacts with the Internet search in a text-based Web browser and learns to answer with references to web pages. While the model is browsing, one of the actions it can take is to quote an extract from the current page. When this is performed, _the page title, domain name and extract_ are recorded to be used later as a reference. The center of WebGPT is to use references to assist humans to judge factual correctness.

The model is first supervised fine-tuned on demonstrations of humans using the web-browsing environment to answer questions for behavior cloning. Comparison data is collected between two model-generated answers to the same question (each with their own set of references), where answers are judged for their _factual accuracy, coherence, and overall usefulness_. Reward model is used for RL training and best-of-n rejection sampling. RL training and best-of-n rejection sampling. In comparison, RL only introduces a small benefit and it is even smaller when rejection sampling is used.

![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/WebGPT-RL.png)

Fig. 24. RL training only introduces slight improvement over BC (behavior cloning) baseline, especially when best-of-n rejection sampling is used. (Image source: [Nakano et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09332))

**GopherCite** ([Menick et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11147)) is quite similar to **WebGPT** on using search engine to create support materials and teaching models to provide references. Both run supervised fine-tuning for bootstrapping and both apply RL training from human preference. But different from WebGPT that depends on human demonstration for behavior cloning, GopherCite generates demonstrations via few-shot prompting and each generation uses context stuffing with relevant documents and then use reward model to score which ones are the best.

One additional trick to avoid low quality response is to configure the model to decline to answer with a canned answer `"I don't know"`, decided by a global RM threshold, known as _selective prediction_.

The empirical results on RL is similar to WebGPT in that RL only brings in limited improvement or no improvement when combined with rejection sampling.

# Appendix: Evaluation Benchmarks

Here is a list of datasets mentioned in this post.

**[TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA)** ([Lin et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958)) is designed to measure how well a LLM can generate truthful responses. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 topics including health, law, finance and politics.

[**FactualityPrompt**](https://github.com/nayeon7lee/FactualityPrompt) ([Lee, et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04624)) is a benchmark consisting of both factual and nonfactual prompts. It relies on Wikipedia documents or sentences as the knowledge base for factuality grounding.

[**SelfAware**](https://github.com/yinzhangyue/SelfAware) ([Yin et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18153)) contains 1,032 unanswerable questions across five categories and 2,337 answerable questions. Unanswerable questions are sourced from online forums with human annotations while answerable questions are sourced from SQuAD, HotpotQA and TriviaQA based on text similarity with unanswerable questions.

[**LongFact**](https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality/tree/main/longfact) ([Wei et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18802) ) is designed for checking long-form generation factuality. It consists of 2280 fact-seeking prompts that seek long-form responses on 38 manually curated topics

[**HaDes**](https://github.com/microsoft/HaDes) ([Liu et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08704)) is a benchmark for hallucination detection as a binary classification task. The dataset is created by perturbing Wikipedia text and human annotation.

[**FEVER**](https://fever.ai/dataset/fever.html) (Fact Extraction and VERification) dataset contains 185,445 claims generated by altering sentences extracted from Wikipedia and subsequently verified without knowledge of the sentence they were derived from. Each claim is classified as `Supported`, `Refuted` or `NotEnoughInfo`.

[**FAVABench**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fava-uw/fava-data) ([Mishra et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06855)) is a benchmark for evaluating fine-grained hallucination. There are 200 information-seeking source prompts and 3 model responses per prompt, resulting in 600 responses in total. Each model response is manually labeled with fine-grained annotations on hallucination error types.
