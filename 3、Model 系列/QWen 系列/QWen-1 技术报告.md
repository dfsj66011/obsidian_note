## 一、引言

LLMs 通过为复杂推理和问题解决任务提供强大的基础，彻底改变了 AI 领域。这些模型能够将海量知识压缩到神经网络中，使它们成为极其多功能的智能体。借助聊天界面，LLMs 可以执行以前被认为仅属于人类专属领域的任务，尤其是那些涉及创造力和专业知识的任务。它们可以与人类进行自然语言对话，回答问题、提供信息，甚至生成故事、诗歌和音乐等创造性内容。这催生了从聊天机器人和虚拟助手到语言翻译和摘要工具等一系列广泛的应用。

LLMs 不局限于语言任务。它们还可以充当通用智能体，与外部系统、工具和模型协作以实现人类设定的目标。例如，LLMs 能够理解多模态指令，执行代码，使用工具等等。这为人工智能应用开辟了一个全新的可能性世界，从自动驾驶汽车和机器人技术到医疗保健和金融领域。随着这些模型不断发展和改进，我们可以期待在未来几年看到更多创新且令人兴奋的应用。无论是帮助我们解决复杂问题、创造新的娱乐形式，还是改变我们的生活和工作方式，LLMs 都有望在塑造人工智能未来方面发挥核心作用。

尽管 LLMs 能力令人印象深刻，但它们常常因可复现性、可控性以及服务提供商获取的便利性不足而受到批评。在本文中，我们很高兴地介绍并发布我们的大语言模型系列 QWEN 的初始版本。QWEN 这一名称源自中文短语“千问”，意为接纳各种各样的询问。QWEN 是一个全面的大语言模型系列，包含参数量各异的独特模型。该模型系列包括基础预训练语言模型、通过人类对齐技术进行微调的聊天模型（即 SFT、基于 RLHF 等），以及专门用于代码和数学的模型。具体细节如下所示：

1. 基础语言模型（即 QWEN）经过大量训练，使用了多达 *3T* 个来自多样化文本和代码的 tokens，涵盖了广泛的领域。这些模型在众多下游任务中始终表现出卓越的性能，即使与规模大得多的同类模型相比也是如此。
2. QWEN-CHAT 模型已在与任务执行、聊天、工具使用、智能体、安全性等相关的精心策划的数据集上进行了微调。基准评估表明，SFT 模型能够实现卓越的性能。此外，我们训练了奖励模型以模拟人类偏好，并将其应用于基于 RLHF，用于生成人类偏好的响应的聊天模型。通过对具有挑战性的测试进行人工评估，我们发现经过 RLHF 训练的 QWEN-CHAT 模型具有很强的竞争力，但在我们的基准测试中*仍落后于 GPT-4*。
3. 此外，我们推出了名为 CODE-QWEN 的专用模型，包括 CODE-QWEN-7B 和 CODE-QWEN-14B，以及它们的对话模型 CODE-QWEN-14B-CHAT 和 CODE-QWEN-7B-CHAT。具体而言，CODE-QWEN 在大量代码数据集上进行了预训练，并进一步微调以处理与代码生成、调试和解释相关的对话。在 HumanEval、MBPP 和 HumanEvalPack 等基准数据集上进行的实验结果表明，CODE-QWEN 在代码理解和生成方面表现出很高的水平。
4. 这项研究还特别介绍了专门用于解决数学问题的 MATH-QWEN-CHAT。我们的结果显示，MATH-QWEN-7B-CHAT 和 MATH-QWEN-14B-CHAT 在相同规模下均大幅超越开源模型，并且在GSM8K 和 MATH 等与数学相关的基准数据集上*接近 GPT-3.5*。

### 2.1 数据

研究表明，数据规模对于开发强大的大型语言模型至关重要，正如先前的研究所强调的。要创建有效的预训练数据集，确保数据具有多样性并涵盖广泛的类型、领域和任务至关重要。我们的数据集旨在满足这些要求，包括公共网络文档、百科全书、书籍、代码等。此外，我们的数据集是多语言的，其中相当一部分*数据是英语和中文*。

为确保预训练数据的质量，我们制定了一套全面的数据预处理流程。对于公开的网页数据，我们从 HTML 中提取文本，并使用语言识别工具来确定语言。为了增加数据的多样性，我们采用了去重技术，包括在规范化后进行精确匹配去重，以及使用 *MinHash 和 LSH 算法* 进行模糊去重。为了过滤低质量数据，我们结合了基于规则和基于机器学习的方法。具体来说，我们使用多个模型对内容进行评分，包括语言模型、文本质量评分模型以及用于识别潜在冒犯性或不恰当内容的模型。我们还从各种来源手动抽样文本并进行审查，以确保其质量。为了进一步提高数据质量，我们有选择地对某些来源的数据进行上采样，以确保我们的模型在多样化的高质量内容上进行训练。最后，我们构建了一个包含多达 *3 万亿* 个标记的数据集。


图3：*不同模型的编码压缩率对比*。我们随机选取各语言100万文档语料进行测试，以XLM-R（Conneau等人，2019年提出，支持100种语言）的压缩率为基准值1（图中未显示）。可以看出，Qwen在确保中英文及代码高效解码的同时，对泰语（th）、希伯来语（he）、阿拉伯语（ar）、韩语（ko）、越南语（vi）、日语（ja）、土耳其语（tr）、印尼语（id）、波兰语（pl）、俄语（ru）、荷兰语（nl）、葡萄牙语（pt）、意大利语（it）、德语（de）、西班牙语（es）、法语（fr）等多种语言仍保持较高压缩率，使模型兼具强大的扩展性以及在这些语言中的高效训练与推理能力。




2.2 TOKENIZATION The design of vocabulary significantly impacts the training efficiency and the downstream task performance. In this study, we utilize byte pair encoding (BPE) as our tokenization method, following GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We start with the open-source fast BPE tokenizer, tiktoken (Jain, 2022), and select the vocabulary cl100k base as our starting point. To enhance the performance of our model on multilingual downstream tasks, particularly in Chinese, we augment the vocabulary with commonly used Chinese characters and words, as well as those in other languages. Also, following Touvron et al. (2023a;b), we have split numbers into single digits. The final vocabulary size is approximately 152K. The performance of the QWEN tokenizer in terms of compression is depicted in Figure 3. In this comparison, we have evaluated QWEN against several other tokenizers, including XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2019), LLaMA Touvron et al. (2023a), Baichuan Inc. (2023a), and InternLM InternLM Team (2023). Our findings reveal that QWEN achieves higher compression efficiency than its competitors in most languages. This implies that the cost of serving can be significantly reduced since a smaller number of tokens from QWEN can convey more information than its competitors. Furthermore, we have conducted preliminary experiments to ensure that scaling the vocabulary size of QWEN does not negatively impact the downstream performance of the pretrained model. Despite the increase in vocabulary size, our experiments have shown that QWEN maintains its performance levels in downstream evaluation. 2.3 MODEL 2.3.1 ARCHITECTURE QWEN is designed using a modified version of the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we have adopted the recent open-source approach of training large language models, LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), which is widely regarded as the top open-source LLM. Our modifications to the architecture include: • Embedding and output projection. Based on preliminary experimental findings, we have opted for the untied embedding approach instead of tying the weights of input embedding and output projection. This decision was made in order to achieve better performance with the price of memory costs. 6 Table 1: Model sizes, architectures, and optimization hyper-parameters. # of Params Hidden size Heads Layers Learning rate Batch size Training tokens 1.8B 2048 16 24 3.0 × 10−4 4M 2.2T 7B 4096 32 32 3.0 × 10−4 4M 2.4T 14B 5120 40 40 3.0 × 10−4 4M 3.0T • Positional embedding. We have chosen RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) (Su et al., 2021) as our preferred option for incorporating positional information into our model. RoPE has been widely adopted and has demonstrated success in contemporary large language models, notably PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b). In particular, we have opted to use FP32 precision for the inverse frequency matrix, rather than BF16 or FP16, in order to prioritize model performance and achieve higher accuracy. • Bias. For most layers, we remove biases following Chowdhery et al. (2022), but we add biases in the QKV layer of attention to enhance the extrapolation ability of the model (Su, 2023b). • Pre-Norm & RMSNorm. In modern Transformer models, pre-normalization is the most widely used approach, which has been shown to improve training stability compared to post-normalization. Recent research has suggested alternative methods for better training stability, which we plan to explore in future versions of our model. Additionally, we have replaced the traditional layer normalization technique described in (Ba et al., 2016) with RMSNorm (Jiang et al., 2023). This change has resulted in equivalent performance while also improving efficiency. • Activation function. We have selected SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020) as our activation function, a combination of Swish (Ramachandran et al., 2017) and Gated Linear Unit (Dauphin et al., 2017). Our initial experiments have shown that activation functions based on GLU generally outperform other baseline options, such as GeLU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016). As is common practice in previous research, we have reduced the dimension of the feed-forward network (FFN) from 4 times the hidden size to 8 3 of the hidden size. 2.3.2 CONTEXT LENGTH EXTENSION Transformer models have a significant limitation in terms of the context length for their attention mechanism. As the context length increases, the quadratic-complexity computation leads to a drastic increase in both computation and memory costs. In this work, we have implemented simple trainingfree techniques that are solely applied during inference to extend the context length of the model. One of the key techniques we have used is NTK-aware interpolation (bloc97, 2023), which adjusts the scale to prevent the loss of high-frequency information in a training-free manner. To further improve performance, we have also implemented a trivial extension called dynamic NTK-aware interpolation, which is later formally discussed in (Peng et al., 2023a). It dynamically changes the scale by chunks, avoiding severe performance degradation. These techniques allow us to effectively extend the context length of Transformer models without compromising their computational efficiency or accuracy. QWEN additionally incorporates two attention mechanisms: LogN-Scaling (Chiang & Cholak, 2022; Su, 2023a) and window attention (Beltagy et al., 2020). LogN-Scaling rescales the dot product of the query and value by a factor that depends on the ratio of the context length to the training length, ensuring that the entropy of the attention value remains stable as the context length grows. Window attention restricts the attention to a limited context window, preventing the model from attending to tokens that are too far away. We also observed that the long-context modeling ability of our model varies across layers, with lower layers being more sensitive in context length extension compared to the higher layers. To leverage this observation, we assign different window sizes to each layer, using shorter windows for lower layers and longer windows for higher layers. 7 Table 2: Overall performance on widely-used benchmarks compared to open-source base models. Our largest QWEN model with 14 billion parameters outperforms previous 13B SoTA models on all datasets.

(2018). This involves training the model to predict the next token based on the context provided by the previous tokens. We train models with context lengths of 2048. To create batches of data, we shuffle and merge the documents, and then truncate them to the specified context lengths. To improve computational efficiency and reduce memory usage, we employ Flash Attention in the attention modules (Dao et al., 2022). We adopt the standard optimizer AdamW (Kingma & Ba, 2014; Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) for pretraining optimization. We set the hyperparameters β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and ϵ = 10−8 . We use a cosine learning rate schedule with a specified peak learning rate for each model size. The learning rate is decayed to a minimum learning rate of 10% of the peak learning rate. All the models are trained with BFloat16 mixed precision for training stability. 2.5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities of our models, we conduct a thorough benchmark assessment using a series of datasets. We compare QWEN with the most recent opensource base models, including LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), MPT (Mosaic ML, 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), Baichuan2 (Yang et al., 2023), ChatGLM2 (ChatGLM2 Team, 2023), InternLM (InternLM Team, 2023), XVERSE (Inc., 2023b), and StableBeluga2 (Stability AI, 2023). Our evaluation covers a total of 7 popular benchmarks, which are MMLU (5-shot) (Hendrycks et al., 2020), C-Eval (5-shot) (Huang et al., 2023), GSM8K (8- shot) (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (4-shot) (Hendrycks et al., 2021), HumanEval (0-shot) (Chen et al., 2021b), MBPP (0-shot) (Austin et al., 2021), and BBH (Big Bench Hard) (3 shot) (Suzgun et al., 2022). We aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the overall performance of our models across these benchmarks. 8 Table 3: Results of QWEN on long-context inference using various techniques. Our experimental findings reveal that the application of our crucial techniques enables the model to consistently achieve low perplexity as the context length increases. This suggests that these techniques play a significant role in enhancing the model’s ability to comprehend and generate lengthy texts.

The results are presented in Table 2. Our experimental results demonstrate that the three QWEN models exhibit exceptional performance across all downstream tasks. It is worth noting that even the larger models, such as LLaMA2-70B, are outperformed by QWEN-14B in 3 tasks. QWEN-7B also performs admirably, surpassing LLaMA2- 13B and achieving comparable results to Baichuan2-13B. Notably, despite having a relatively small number of parameters, QWEN-1.8B is capable of competitive performance on certain tasks and even outperforms larger models in some instances. The findings highlight the impressive capabilities of the QWEN models, particularly QWEN-14B, and suggest that smaller models, such as QWEN-1.8B, can still achieve strong performance in certain applications. To evaluate the effectiveness of context length extension, Table 3 presents the test results on arXiv3 in terms of perplexity (PPL). These results demonstrate that by combining NTK-aware interpolation, LogN-Scaling, and layer-wise window assignment, we can effectively maintain the performance of our models in the context of over 8192 tokens. 3 ALIGNMENT Pretrained large language models have been found to be out of sync with human behavior, making them unsuitable for serving as AI assistants in most cases. Recent research has shown that the use of alignment techniques, such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), can significantly improve the ability of language models to engage in natural conversation. In this section, we will delve into the details of how Qwen models have been trained using SFT and RLHF, and evaluate their performance in the context of chat-based assistance. 3.1 SUPERVISED FINETUNING To gain an understanding of human behavior, the initial step is to carry out supervised finetuning. This process fine-tunes a pre-trained model on chat-style data, which includes both human queries and AI responses. Supervised finetuning is similar to text-to-text transfer, but it is capable of creating a helpful AI assistant due to the intricate and varied nature of the datasets used for finetuning. In the following sections, we will delve into the details of data construction and training methods. 3.1.1 DATA To enhance the capabilities of our supervised finetuning datasets, we have annotated conversations in multiple styles. While conventional FLAN datasets (Wei et al., 2022a) contain a vast amount of data prompted with questions, instructions, and answers in natural language, our approach takes it a step further by annotating human-style conversations. This practice, inspired by Ouyang et al. 3The dataset contains academic papers from https://arxiv.org/ 9 (2022), is aimed at improving the model’s helpfulness by focusing on natural language generation for diverse tasks. To ensure the model’s ability to generalize to a wide range of scenarios, we specifically excluded data formatted in prompt templates that could potentially limit its capabilities. Furthermore, we have prioritized the safety of the language model by annotating data related to safety concerns such as violence, bias, and pornography. This will enable the model to detect and reject malicious prompts or provide safe answers in such situations. In addition to data quality, we have observed that the training method can significantly impact the final performance of the model. To achieve this, we utilized the ChatML-style format (OpenAI, 2022), which is a versatile meta language capable of describing both the metadata (such as roles) and the content of a turn. This format enables the model to effectively distinguish between various types of information, including system setup, user inputs, and assistant outputs, among others. By leveraging this approach, we can enhance the model’s ability to accurately process and analyze complex conversational data. 3.1.2 TRAINING Consistent with pretraining, we also apply next-token prediction as the training task for SFT. We apply the loss masks for the system and user inputs. More details are demonstrated in Appendix A.1.1. The model’s training process utilizes the AdamW optimizer, with the following hyperparameters: β1 set to 0.9, β2 set to 0.95, and ϵ set to 10−8 . The sequence length is limited to 2048, and the batch size is 128. The model undergoes a total of 4000 steps, with the learning rate gradually increased over the first 1430 steps, reaching a peak of 2 × 10−6 . To prevent overfitting, weight decay is applied with a value of 0.1, dropout regularization is set to 0.1, and gradient clipping is enforced with a limit of 1.0. 3.2 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK While SFT has proven to be effective, we acknowledge that its generalization and creativity capabilities may be limited, and it is prone to overfitting. To address this issue, we have implemented Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to further align SFT models with human preferences, following the approaches of Ouyang et al. (2022); Christiano et al. (2017). This process involves training a reward model and using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) to conduct policy training. 3.2.1 REWARD MODEL To create a successful reward model, like building a large language model (LLM), it is crucial to first undergo pretraining and then finetuning. This pretraining process, also known as preference model pretraining (PMP) (Bai et al., 2022b), necessitates a vast dataset of comparison data. This dataset consists of sample pairs, each containing two distinct responses for a single query and their corresponding preferences. Similarly, finetuning is also conducted on this type of comparison data, but with a higher quality due to the presence of quality annotations. During the fine-tuning phase, we gather a variety of prompts and adjust the reward model based on human feedback for responses from the QWEN models. To ensure the diversity and complexity of user prompts are properly taken into account, we have created a classification system with around 6600 detailed tags and implemented a balanced sampling algorithm that considers both diversity and complexity when selecting prompts for annotation by the reward model (Lu et al., 2023). To generate a wide range of responses, we have utilized QWEN models of different sizes and sampling strategies, as diverse responses can help reduce annotation difficulties and enhance the performance of the reward model. These responses are then evaluated by annotators following a standard annotation guideline, and comparison pairs are formed based on their scores. In creating the reward model, we utilize the same-sized pre-trained language model QWEN and initiate the PMP process. Subsequently, we fine-tune the PMP model to enhance its performance. It is important to mention that we have incorporated a pooling layer into the original QWEN model to extract the reward for a sentence based on a specific end token. The learning rate for this process has been set to a constant value of 3 × 10−6 , and the batch size is 64. Additionally, the sequence length is set to 2048, and the training process lasts for a single epoch. 10 Table 4: Test Accuracy of QWEN PMP and reward model on diverse human preference benchmark datasets.

Before starting the PPO procedure, we pause the policy model’s updates and focus solely on updating the value model for 50 steps. This approach ensures that the value model can adapt to different reward models effectively. During the PPO operation, we use a strategy of sampling two responses for each query simultaneously. This strategy has proven to be more effective based on our internal benchmarking evaluations. We set the KL divergence coefficient to 0.04 and normalize the reward based on the running mean. The policy and value models have learning rates of 1 × 10−6 and 5 × 10−6 , respectively. To enhance training stability, we utilize value loss clipping with a clip value of 0.15. For inference, the policy top-p is set to 0.9. Our findings indicate that although the entropy is slightly lower than when top-p is set to 1.0, there is a faster increase in reward, ultimately resulting in consistently higher evaluation rewards under similar conditions. Additionally, we have implemented a pre-trained gradient to mitigate the alignment tax. Empirical findings indicate that, with this specific reward model, the KL penalty is adequately robust to counteract the alignment tax in benchmarks that are not strictly code or math in nature, such as those that test common sense knowledge and reading comprehension. It is imperative to utilize a significantly larger volume of the pretrained data in comparison to the PPO data to ensure the effectiveness of the pretrained gradient. Additionally, our empirical study suggests that an overly large value for this coefficient can considerably impede the alignment to the reward model, eventually compromising the ultimate alignment, while an overly small value would only have a marginal effect on alignment tax reduction. 3.3 AUTOMATIC AND HUMAN EVALUATION OF ALIGNED MODELS To showcase the effectiveness of our aligned models, we conduct a comparison with other aligned models on well-established benchmarks, including MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021b), and BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022). Besides the widely used few-shot setting, we test our aligned models in the zero-shot setting to demonstrate how well the models follow instructions. The prompt in a zero-shot setting consists of an instruction and a question without any previous examples in the context. The results of the baselines are collected from their official reports and OpenCompass (OpenCompass Team, 2023). The results in Table 5 demonstrate the effectiveness of our aligned models in understanding human instructions and generating appropriate responses. QWEN-14B-Chat outperforms all other models except ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and LLAMA 2-CHAT-70B (Touvron et al., 2023b) in all datasets, including MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021b), and BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022). In particular, QWEN’s performance in HumanEval, which measures the quality of generated codes, is significantly higher than that of other open-source models. Moreover, QWEN’s performance is consistently better than that of open-source models of similar size, such as LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), ChatGLM2 (ChatGLM2 Team, 2023), InternLM (InternLM Team, 2023), and Baichuan2 (Yang et al., 2023). This suggests that our alignment approach, which involves fine-tuning the model on a large dataset of human conversations, has been effective in improving the model’s ability to understand and generate human-like language. 11 Table 5: Performance of aligned models on widely-used benchmarks.

GPT-3.5) Qwen-7B-Chat (SFT) Qwen-14B-Chat (SFT) Qwen-14B-Chat (RLHF) GPT-4 Figure 4: Results of the human evaluation for chat models. We compare Qwen-7B (SFT), Qwen14B (SFT), Qwen-14B (RLHF), as well as GPT-4 against GPT-3.5. Each bar segment represents the percentage of wins, ties, and losses, from bottom to top. On average, the RLHF model outperforms the SFT model and falls behind GPT-4 by a relatively small margin. 12 Despite this, we have reservations about the ability of traditional benchmark evaluation to accurately measure the performance and potential of chat models trained with alignment techniques in today’s landscape. The results mentioned earlier provide some evidence of our competitive standing, but we believe that it is crucial to develop new evaluation methods specifically tailored to aligned models. We believe that human evaluation is crucial, which is why we have created a carefully curated dataset for this purpose. Our process involved collecting 300 instructions in Chinese that covered a wide range of topics, including knowledge, language understanding, creative writing, coding, and mathematics. To evaluate the performance of different models, we chose the SFT version of QWENCHAT-7B and the SFT and RLHF version of QWEN-CHAT-14B, and added two strong baselines, GPT-3.5 and GPT-44 , for comparison. For each instruction, we asked three annotators to rank the model responses by the overall score of helpfulness, informativeness, validity, and other relevant factors. Our dataset and evaluation methodology provides a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the capabilities of different language models in various domains. Figure 4 illustrates the win rates of the various models. For each model, we report the percentage of wins, ties, and losses against GPT-3.5, with the segments of each bar from bottom to top representing these statistics. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the RLHF model outperforms the SFT models by significant margins, indicating that RLHF can encourage the model to generate responses that are more preferred by humans. In terms of overall performance, we find that the RLHF model significantly outperforms the SFT models, slightly falling behind GPT-4. This indicates the effectiveness of RLHF for aligning to human preference. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the models’ performance, we include a case study with examples from different models in Appendix A.2.2. 3.4 TOOL USE, CODE INTERPRETER, AND AGENT Table 6: Performance of QWEN on the in-house Chinese benchmark that evaluates its ability to use unseen tools via ReAct prompting.

As such, they can serve as agents or copilots to help streamline various tasks. We explore QWEN’s proficiency in the following areas: • Utilizing unseen tools through ReAct prompting (Yao et al., 2022) (see Table 6). • Using a Python code interpreter to enhance math reasoning, data analysis, and more (see Table 7 and Table 8). • Functioning as an agent that accesses Hugging Face’s extensive collection of multimodal models while engaging with humans (see Table 9). To enhance QWEN’s capabilities as an agent or copilot, we employ the self-instruct (Wang et al., 2023c) strategy for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Specifically, we utilize the in-context learning capability of QWEN for self-instruction. By providing a few examples, we can prompt QWEN to generate more relevant queries and generate outputs that follow a specific format, such as ReAct. We then apply rules and involve human annotators to filter out any noisy samples. Afterwards, the samples are incorporated into QWEN’s training data, resulting in an updated version of QWEN that is more dependable for self-instruction. We iterate through this process multiple times until we gather 4To obtain the results from the models, we use the OpenAI APIs of GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 and GPT-4-0613. 13 Table 7: The proportion of code generated by QWEN that is executable on the in-house evaluation benchmark for Code Interpreter. This benchmark examines QWEN’s coding proficiency in math problem solving, data visualization, and general purposes.

As a result, our final collection consists of around 2000 high-quality samples. During the fine-tuning process, we mix these high-quality samples with all the other general-purpose SFT samples, rather than introducing an additional training stage. By doing so, we are able to retain essential general-purpose capabilities that are also pertinent for constructing agent applications. Using Tools via ReAct Prompting We have created and made publicly available a benchmark for evaluating QWEN’s ability to call plugins, tools, functions, or APIs using ReAct Prompting (see Qwen Team, Alibaba Cloud, 2023b). To ensure fair evaluation, we have excluded any plugins that were included in QWEN’s training set from the evaluation set. The benchmark assesses the model’s accuracy in selecting the correct plugin from a pool of up to five candidates, as well as the plausibility of the parameters passed into the plugin and the frequency of false positives. In this evaluation, a false positive occurs when the model incorrectly invokes a plugin in response to a query, despite not being required to do so. The results presented in Table 6 demonstrate that QWEN consistently achieves higher accuracy in identifying the relevance of a query to the available tools as the model size increases. However, the table also highlights that beyond a certain point, there is little improvement in performance when it comes to selecting the appropriate tool and providing relevant arguments. This suggests that the current preliminary benchmark may be relatively easy and may require further enhancement in future iterations. It is worth noting that GPT-3.5 stands out as an exception, displaying suboptimal performance on this particular benchmark. This could potentially be attributed to the fact that the benchmark primarily focuses on the Chinese language, which may not align well with GPT-3.5’s capabilities. Additionally, we observe that GPT-3.5 tends to attempt to use at least one tool, even if the query cannot be effectively addressed by the provided tools. Using Code Interpreter for Math Reasoning and Data Analysis The Python code interpreter is widely regarded as a powerful tool for augmenting the capabilities of an LLM agent. It is worth investigating whether QWEN can harness the full potential of this interpreter to enhance its performance in diverse domains, such as mathematical reasoning and data analysis. To facilitate this exploration, we have developed and made publicly available a benchmark that is specifically tailored for this purpose (see Qwen Team, Alibaba Cloud, 2023a). The benchmark encompasses three primary categories of tasks: math problem-solving, data visualization, and other general-purpose tasks like file post-processing and web crawling. Within the 15 visualization tasks, we differentiate between two levels of difficulty. The easier level can be achieved by simply writing and executing a single code snippet without the need for advanced planning skills. However, the more challenging level requires strategic planning and executing multiple code snippets in a sequential manner. This is because the subsequent code must be written based on the output of the previous code. For example, an agent may need to examine the structure of a CSV file using one code snippet before proceeding to write and execute additional code to create a plot. Regarding evaluation metrics, we consider both the executability and correctness of the generated code. To elaborate on the correctness metrics, for math problems, we measure accuracy by verifying if the ground truth numerical answer is present in both the code execution result and the final response. When it comes to data visualization, we assess accuracy by utilizing QWEN-VL (Bai et al., 2023), a powerful multimodal language model. QWEN-VL is capable of answering text questions paired with images, and we rely on it to confirm whether the image generated by the code fulfills the user’s request. The results regarding executability and correctness are presented in Table 7 and Table 8, respectively. It is evident that CODE LLAMA generally outperforms LLAMA 2, its generalist counterpart, which is not surprising since this benchmark specifically requires coding skills. However, it is worth noting that specialist models that are optimized for code synthesis do not necessarily outperform generalist models. This is due to the fact that this benchmark encompasses various skills beyond coding, such as abstracting math problems into equations, understanding language-specified constraints, and responding in the specified format such as ReAct. Notably, QWEN-7B-CHAT and QWEN-14B-CHAT surpass all other open-source alternatives of similar scale significantly, despite being generalist models. Serving as a Hugging Face Agent Hugging Face provides a framework called the Hugging Face Agent or Transformers Agent (Hugging Face, 2023), which empowers LLM agents with a curated set of multimodal tools, including speech recognition and image synthesis. This framework allows an LLM agent to interact with humans, interpret natural language commands, and employ the provided tools as needed. To evaluate QWEN’s effectiveness as a Hugging Face agent, we utilized the evaluation benchmarks offered by Hugging Face. The results are presented in Table 9. The evaluation results reveal that QWEN performs quite well in comparison to other open-source alternatives, only slightly behind the proprietary GPT-4, demonstrating QWEN’s competitive capabilities. 4 CODE-QWEN: SPECIALIZED MODEL FOR CODING Training on domain-specific data has been shown to be highly effective, particularly in the case of code pretraining and finetuning. A language model that has been reinforced with training on code data can serve as a valuable tool for coding, debugging, and interpretation, among other tasks. In this work, we have developed a series of generalist models using pretraining and alignment techniques. Building on this foundation, we have created domain-specific models for coding by leveraging the base language models of QWEN. We have implemented continued pretraining on code data for CODE-QWEN and then applied supervised finetuning to create CODE-QWEN-CHAT. The code models, CODE-QWEN-14B and CODE-QWEN-7B, are based on base language models with 14 billion and 7 billion parameters. 4.1 CODE PRETRAINING Unlike previous approaches that focused solely on pretraining on code data (Li et al., 2022; 2023d), we take a different approach (Roziere et al., 2023) by starting with our base language models, ` CODEQWEN-14B-CHAT and CODE-QWEN-7B-CHAT, and then continuing to pretrain on a combination of text and code data. We believe that relying solely on code data for pretraining can result in a significant loss of the ability to function as a versatile assistant. Additionally, incorporating data from a diverse range of domains can help enhance the models’ ability to understand and generate code, as well as bridge the gap between language and coding. We continue to pretrain the models on a total of around 90 billion tokens. 16 In the pretraining process, we initialize the model by corresponding base language models, CODEQWEN-14B-CHAT and CODE-QWEN-7B-CHAT. Most applications depend on specialized models for coding may lead to long contextual scenarios, such as tool use and code interpreter in Section 3.4. In that case, we train models with context lengths of 8192. Similar to base model training in Section 2.4, we employ Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022) in the attention modules, and adopt the standard optimizer AdamW (Kingma & Ba, 2014; Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017), setting β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and ϵ = 10−8 . We set the learning rate as 3.0×10−5 for CODE-QWEN-7B and 6.0×10−5 CODE-QWEN-14B, with 3% warm up iterations and no learning rate decays. 4.2 CODE SUPERVISED FINE-TUNING After conducting a series of empirical experiments, we have determined that the multi-stage SFT strategy yields the best performance compared to other methods. In the supervised fine-tuning stage, the models CODE-QWEN-7B-CHAT and CODE-QWEN-14B-CHAT initialized by the code foundation model CODE-QWEN-7B-CHAT and CODE-QWEN-14B-CHAT are optimized by the AdamW (Kingma & Ba, 2014; Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) optimizer (β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, ϵ = 10−8 ) with a learning rate of 1.0 × 10−5 and 2.0 × 10−6 , respectively. The learning rate increases to the peaking value with the cosine learning rate schedule (3% warm-up steps) and remains constant. 4.3 EVALUATION Our CODE-QWEN models have been compared with both proprietary and open-source language models, as shown in Tables 11 and 10. These tables present the results of our evaluation on the test sets of Humaneval (Chen et al., 2021b), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), and the multi-lingual code generation benchmark HUMANEVALPACK (Muennighoff et al., 2023). The comparison is based on the pass@1 performance of the models on these benchmark datasets. The results of this comparison are clearly demonstrated in Tables 10 and 11. Our analysis reveals that specialized models, specifically CODE-QWEN and CODE-QWEN-CHAT, significantly outperform previous baselines with similar parameter counts, such as OCTOGEEX (Muennighoff et al., 2023), InstructCodeT5+ (Wang et al., 2023d), and CodeGeeX2 (Zheng et al., 2023). In fact, these models even rival the performance of larger models like Starcoder (Li et al., 2023d) and WizardCoder-15B (Luo et al., 2023b). When compared to some of the extremely large-scale closed-source models, CODE-QWEN and CODEQWEN-CHAT demonstrate clear advantages in terms of pass@1. However, it is important to note that these models fall behind the state-of-the-art methods, such as GPT-4, in general. Nonetheless, with the continued scaling of both model size and data size, we believe that this gap can be narrowed in the near future. It is crucial to emphasize that the evaluations mentioned previously are insufficient for grasping the full extent of the strengths and weaknesses of the models. In our opinion, it is crucial to develop more rigorous tests to enable us to accurately assess our relative performance in comparison to GPT-4. 5 MATH-QWEN: SPECIALIZED MODEL FOR MATHEMATICS REASONING We have created a mathematics-specialized model series called MATH-QWEN-CHAT, which is built on top of the QWEN pretrained language models. Specifically, we have developed assistant models that are specifically designed to excel in arithmetic and mathematics and are aligned with human behavior. These models are referred to as MATH-QWEN-CHAT. We are releasing two versions of this model series, MATH-QWEN-14B-CHAT and MATH-QWEN-7B-CHAT, which have 14 billion and 7 billion parameters, respectively. 5.1 TRAINING We carry out math SFT on our augmented math instructional dataset for mathematics reasoning, and therefore we obtain the chat model, MATH-QWEN-CHAT, directly. Owing to shorter average lengths of the math SFT data, we use a sequence length of 1024 for faster training. Most user inputs 17 Table 10: Results of pass@1 (%) on HumanEval and MBPP.

For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with the same hyperparameters of SFT except that we use a peak learning rate of 2 × 10−5 and a training step of 50 000. 5.2 EVALUATION We evaluate models on the test sets of GSM8K (Grade school math) (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Challenging competition math problems) (Hendrycks et al., 2021), Math401 (Arithmetic ability) (Yuan et al., 2023b), and Math23K (Chinese grade school math) (Wang et al., 2017).

MATH-QWEN-CHAT models show better math reasoning and arithmetic abilities compared to open-sourced models and QWEN-CHAT models of similar sizes. Compared to proprietary models, MATH-QWEN-CHAT-7B outperforms Minerva-8B in MATH. MATH-QWEN-14B-CHAT is chasing Minerva-62B and GPT-3.5 in GSM8K and MATH and delivers better performance on arithmetic ability and Chinese math problems. 6 RELATED WORK 6.1 LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS The excitement of LLM began with the introduction of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which was then applied to pretraining large-scale data by researchers such as Radford et al. (2018); Devlin et al. (2018); Liu et al. (2019). These efforts led to significant success in transfer learning, with model sizes growing from 100 million to over 10 billion parameters (Raffel et al., 2020; Shoeybi et al., 2019). In 2020, the release of GPT-3, a massive language model that is 10 times larger than T5, demonstrated the incredible potential of few-shot and zero-shot learning through prompt engineering and in-context learning, and later chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022c). This success has led to a number of studies exploring the possibilities of further scaling these models (Scao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Du et al., 2021; Zeng et al., 2022; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022). As a result, the community has come to view these large language models as essential foundations for downstream models (Bommasani et al., 2021). The birth of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and the subsequent launch of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) marked two historic moments in the field of artificial intelligence, demonstrating that large language models (LLMs) can serve as effective AI assistants capable of communicating with humans. These events have sparked interests among researchers and developers in building language models that are aligned with human values and potentially even capable of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) (Anil et al., 2023; Anthropic, 2023a;b). One notable development in this area is the emergence of open-source LLMs, specifically LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) and LLAMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), which have been recognized as the most powerful open-source language models ever created. This has led to a surge of activity in the open-source community (Wolf et al., 2019), with a series of large language models being developed collaboratively to build upon this progress (Mosaic ML, 2023; Almazrouei et al., 2023; ChatGLM2 Team, 2023; Yang et al., 2023; InternLM Team, 2023). 6.2 ALIGNMENT The community was impressed by the surprising effectiveness of alignment on LLMs. Previously, LLMs without alignment often struggle with issues such as repetitive generation, hallucination, and deviation from human preferences. Since 2021, researchers have been diligently working on developing methods to enhance the performance of LLMs in downstream tasks (Wei et al., 2022a; 20 Sanh et al., 2021; Longpre et al., 2023; Chung et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2022). Furthermore, researchers have been actively exploring ways to align LLMs with human instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Askell et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022b;c). One major challenge in alignment research is the difficulty of collecting data. While OpenAI has utilized its platform to gather human prompts or instructions, it is not feasible for others to collect such data. However, there has been some progress in this area, such as the self-instruct approach proposed in Wang et al. (2023c). This innovative work offers a potential solution to the data collection problem in alignment research. As a result, there has been a surge in open-source chat data, including Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), MOSS (Sun et al., 2023a), Dolly (Conover et al., 2023), Evol-Instruct (Xu et al., 2023b), and others (Sun et al., 2023b; Xu et al., 2023a;c; Chen et al., 2023b; Ding et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023; Yang, 2023). Similarly, there has been an increase in open-source chat models, such as Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), Guanaco (Dettmers et al., 2023), MOSS (Sun et al., 2023a), WizardLM (Xu et al., 2023b), and others (Xu et al., 2023c; Chen et al., 2023b; Ding et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b). To train an effective chat model, available solutions are mostly based on SFT and RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022). While SFT is similar to pretraining, it focuses on instruction following using the aforementioned data. However, for many developers, the limited memory capacity is a major obstacle to further research in SFT. As a result, parameter-efficient tuning methods, such as LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) and Q-LoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023), have gained popularity in the community. LoRA tunes only low-rank adapters, while Q-LoRA builds on LoRA and utilizes 4-bit quantized LLMs and paged attention (Dettmers et al., 2022; Frantar et al., 2022; Kwon et al., 2023). In terms of RLHF, recent methods such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017; Touvron et al., 2023b) have been adopted, but there are also alternative techniques aimed at addressing the complexity of optimization, such as RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023c), DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), and PRO (Song et al., 2023). Despite the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of RLHF, more evidence is needed to understand how it enhances the intelligence of LLMs and what potential drawbacks it may have. 6.3 TOOL USE AND AGENTS LLM’s planning function allows for the invocation of tools, such as APIs or agent capabilities, through in-context learning, as demonstrated by Schick et al. (2023). Yao et al. (2022) introduced ReAct, a generation format that enables the model to generate thoughts on which tool to use, accept input from API observations, and generate a response. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, when prompted with few shots, have shown consistent and impressive performance. In addition to tool usage, LLMs can utilize external memory sources like knowledge bases (Hu et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2023b) or search engines (Nakano et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023b) to generate more accurate and informative answers. This has led to the popularity of frameworks like LangChain (LangChain, Inc., 2023). The research on LLMs for tool use has also sparked interest in building agents with LLM capabilities, such as agents that can call different AI models (Shen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a), embodied lifelong learning or multimodal agents (Wang et al., 2023a; Driess et al., 2023), and multiple agents interacting with each other and even building a micro-society (Chen et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023b; Xu et al., 2023d; Hong et al., 2023). 6.4 LLM FOR CODING Previous research has demonstrated that LLMs possess remarkable capabilities in code understanding and generation, particularly those with massive numbers of parameters (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Moreover, several LLMs have been pretrained, continued pre-trained, or fine-tuned on coding-related data, which has resulted in significantly improved performance compared to general-purpose LLMs. These models include Codex Chen et al. (2021a), AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022), SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023), Starcoder-Base (Li et al., 2023d), InCoder (Fried et al., 2022), CodeT5 (Wang et al., 2021), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023), and CODE LLAMA (Roziere et al., 2023). In addition to these models, recent studies have focused on ` developing specialized alignment techniques for coding, such as Code Llama-Instruct (Roziere et al., ` 2023) and StarCoder (Li et al., 2023d). These models can assist developers in various code-related tasks, including code generation (Chen et al., 2021b; Austin et al., 2021), code completion (Zhang et al., 2023a), code translation (Szafraniec et al., 2023), bug fixing (Muennighoff et al., 2023), code 21 refinement (Liu et al., 2023c), and code question answering (Liu & Wan, 2021). In a word, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize the field of coding by providing developers with powerful tools for code comprehension, generation, and related tasks. 6.5 LLM FOR MATHEMATICS LLMs with a certain model scale have been found to possess the ability to perform mathematical reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b; Suzgun et al., 2022). In order to encourage LLMs to achieve better performance on math-related tasks, researchers have employed techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022c) and scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021), which have shown promising results. Additionally, self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022) and least-to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2022) have further improved the performance of these models on these tasks. However, prompt engineering is a time-consuming process that requires a lot of trial and error, and it is still difficult for LLMs to consistently perform well or achieve satisfactory results in solving mathematical problems. Moreover, simply scaling the data and model size is not an efficient way to improve a model’s mathematical reasoning abilities. Instead, pretraining on math-related corpora has been shown to consistently enhance these capabilities (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Taylor et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023). Additionally, fine-tuning on math-related instruction-following datasets (Si et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023a; Luo et al., 2023a; Yue et al., 2023; Chern et al., 2023a; Yu et al., 2023), has also been effective and more cost-effective than math-specific pretraining. Despite their limitations in terms of accuracy, LLMs still have significant potential to assist users with practical mathematical problems. There is ample scope for further development in this area. 7 CONCLUSION In this report, we present the QWEN series of large language models, which showcase the latest advancements in natural language processing. With 14B, 7B, and 1.8B parameters, these models have been pre-trained on massive amounts of data, including trillions of tokens, and fine-tuned using cutting-edge techniques such as SFT and RLHF. Additionally, the QWEN series includes specialized models for coding and mathematics, such as CODE-QWEN, CODE-QWEN-CHAT, and MATH-QWENCHAT, which have been trained on domain-specific data to excel in their respective fields. Our results demonstrate that the QWEN series is competitive with existing open-source models and even matches the performance of some proprietary models on comprehensive benchmarks and human evaluation. We believe that the open access of QWEN will foster collaboration and innovation within the community, enabling researchers and developers to build upon our work and push the boundaries of what is possible with language models. By providing these models to the public, we hope to inspire new research and applications that will further advance the field and contribute to our understanding of the variables and techniques introduced in realistic settings. In a nutshell, the QWEN series represents a major milestone in our development of large language models, and we are excited to see how it will be used to drive progress and innovation in the years to come. 22 REFERENCES Loubna Ben Allal, Raymond Li, Denis Kocetkov, Chenghao Mou, Christopher Akiki, Carlos Munoz Ferrandis, Niklas Muennighoff, Mayank Mishra, Alex Gu, Manan Dey, et al.

ArXiv, abs/2205.10625, 2022. 34 A APPENDIX A.1 MORE TRAINING DETAILS A.1.1 DATA FORMAT FOR QWEN-CHAT Different from conventional pretraining based on autoregressive next-token prediction, despite using a similar training task, there should be a specially design data format for SFT and RLHF to build a conversational AI assistant model. Common formats include “human-assistant” and ChatML formats. As to our knowledge, the earliest example of the human-assistant format comes from Anthropic (Bai et al., 2022b), which adds a special phrase “\n\nhuman: ” in front of the user input and “\n\nassistant: ” in front of the assistant response. It is easy for the base language model to transfer to the pattern of conversational AI. However, as the specific phrases are common words, it might be hard for the model to disambiguate from these words in other contexts. Instead, we turned to the ChatML format proposed by OpenAI.5 This format allows the use of special tokens, i.e., “” and “”, that do not appear in pretraining, and thus resolve the aforementioned problem. We demonstrate an example of the format below. ChatML Format <| i m s t a r t |>system You a r e a h e l p f u l a s s i s t a n t . <| im end |> <| i m s t a r t |> u s e r H e l l o !<| im end |> <| i m s t a r t |> a s s i s t a n t H e l l o ! How can I a s s i s t you t o d a y ?<| im end |> A.2 EVALUATION A.2.1 AUTOMATIC EVALUATION To provide a whole picture of the performance of our model series QWEN, here in this section we illustrate the detailed performance of our models as well as the baselines in the comprehensive benchmark evaluation proposed by OpenCompass Team (2023). We report the results in multiple tables based on the officially provided categories, including examination, language, knowledge, understanding, and reasoning. In terms of the performance of the baseline models, we report the higher results between the reported ones and those on the leaderboard. Examination Here we evaluate the models on a series of datasets relevant to the examination. The datasets include • MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) Massive Multi-task Language Understanding is designed for measuring language understanding capabilities. We report 5-shot results. • C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023) C-Eval is a Chinese evaluation dataset spanning 52 diverse disciplines. We report 5-shot results. • CMMLU (Li et al., 2023c) CMMLU is designed for assessing language understanding capabilities in Chinese. We report 5-shot results. • AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023a) This is a benchmark consisting of human-centric examinations, including college entrance exams, law school admission tests, math competitions, and lawyer qualification tests. We report zero-shot results. • Gaokao-Bench (Zhang et al., 2023b) This is a benchmark with Gaokao (Chinese collegeentrance examination) questions. We report zero-shot results. • ARC (Clark et al., 2018) ARC is a dataset consisting of grade-school level, multiple-choice science questions. It includes an easy set and a challenge set, which are referred by ARC-e and ARC-c. We report zero-shot results. 35 Table 13: Results on MMLU. All are tested with five-shot accuracy.

Additionally, while CMMLU, AGIEval, and Gaokao-Bench are related to Chinese, and MPT, Falcon, and the LLaMA series were not optimized for Chinese, these models achieved low performance on the datasets. Knowledge and Understanding Here we evaluate the models on a series of datasets relevant to knowledge and natural language understanding. The datasets include • BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019) This is a QA dataset, where the questions are about passages of Wikipedia, and the model should answer yes or no to the given possible answer. We report zero-shot results. • CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2019) This is a dataset of multiple-choice question answering that asseses the understanding of commonsense knowledge. We report 8-shot results. • NaturalQuestions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) It is a dataset of QA where the questions are from users and the answers are verified by experts. We report zero-shot results. • LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016) This is dataset to evaluate language understanding by word prediction. It consists of passages related to human subjects. We report zero-shot results. We report the results in Table 16. Reasoning We report the evaluation results on the datasets concerning reasoning, focusing on natural language reasoning. For the others, such as mathematics and coding, as we have illustrated detailed results, here we do not report those results repeatedly. The datasets for evaluation include: • HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019) This is a commonsense natural language inference (NLI) dataset, where the questions are easy for humans but struggling for previous language models. We report zero-shot results. • PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020) This is an NLI dataset assessing the physical knowledge.

What is the perimeter of the square in centimeters? Responses Model Response Elo Qwen-7B-Chat (SFT) 设正方形的边长为x，那么每个长方形的边长就是x/5。根据 题意，我们知道每个长方形的周长是60厘米，所以有： 2(x/5) + 2(x/5) + 2(x/5) + 2(x/5) = 60 化简得：x = 60/(2 + 2 + 2 + 2) = 15 所以正方形的周长是4x = 4 ∗ 15 = 60厘米 976 If the side length of a square is x, then the side length of each rectangle is x/5. According to the question, we know that the perimeter of each rectangle is 60 centimeters, so we have: 2(x/5) + 2(x/5) + 2(x/5) + 2(x/5) = 60 Simplifying, we get: x = 60/(2 + 2 + 2 + 2) = 15 So the perimeter of the square is 4x = 4 ∗ 15 = 60 centimeters. 47 Qwen-14B-Chat (SFT) 设正方形边长为x，长方形边长为y 根据题意，有：x = 5y 2y + 2y = 60 4y = 60 y = 15 x = 5 ∗ 15 = 75 正方形周长= 4x = 4 ∗ 75 = 300 976 Let the side length of the square be x and the length of the rectangle be y. According to the problem: x = 5y 2y + 2y = 60 4y = 60 y = 15 x = 5 ∗ 15 = 75 Perimeter of the square = 4x = 4 ∗ 75 = 300 Qwen-14B-Chat (RLHF) 首先，我们设正方形的边长为x，则每个长方形的长为x，宽 为x/5。 根据长方形的周长公式，可得每个长方形的周长为2(x + x/5) = 12x/5。 已知每个长方形的周长为60厘米，代入上式得： 12x/5 = 60 解得x = 25。 因此，正方形的周长为4x = 100厘米。 答案：正方形的周长是100厘米。 1139 First, let’s assume that the square’s side length is x. Therefore, the length of each rectangle is x and the width is x/5. According to the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, we can determine that the perimeter of each rectangle is 2(x + x/5) = 12x/5. Given that the perimeter of each rectangle is 60 centimeters, we can substitute this value into the equation: 12x/5 = 60 Solving for x, we find x = 25. Therefore, the perimeter of the square is 4x = 100 centimeters. Answer: The perimeter of the square is 100 centimeters. GPT-3.5 设正方形的边长为x厘米，则每个长方形的长为x厘米，宽 为5x/4厘米。 每个长方形的周长为2(x + 5x/4) = 60厘米。 化简得13x/2 = 60 解方程得到x = (60 ∗ 2)/13 = 120/13H9.23 正方形的周长为4x = 4 ∗ 9.23 ≈ 36.92厘米。 897 If the side length of a square is x centimeters, then the length of each rectangle is x centimeters, and the width is 5x/4 centimeters. The perimeter of each rectangle is 2(x + 5x/4) = 60 centimeters. Simplifying, we get 13x/2 = 60. Solving the equation, we find x = (60 * 2) / 13 = 120 / 13 ≈ 9.23. The perimeter of the square is 4x = 4 * 9.23 ≈ 36.92 centimeters. GPT-4 由题意可知，每个长方形的一条长边等于正方形的边长，设 为a。设每个长方形的一条短边为b，那么有5b = a。根据每 个长方形的周长可得到2 ∗ (a + b) = 60厘米。将5b = a代 入到长方形的周长公式中得：2 ∗ a + 2 ∗ 5b = 60，化简 得2 ∗ a + 10b = 60，由于a = 5b，所以2 ∗ a = 2 ∗ 5b = 10b 那么有10b + 10b = 60，得b = 3厘米，a = 5 ∗ b = 15厘米。 所以，正方形的周长是4 ∗ a = 4 ∗ 15 = 60厘米。 1010 48 From the given problem, it can be inferred that the length of one side of each rectangle is equal to that of one side of the square, denoted as a. Let the length of one side of each rectangle be denoted as b; then, we have 5b = a. The perimeter of each rectangle can be obtained as 2 ∗ (a + b) = 60 centimeters. Substituting 5b = a into the formula for the perimeter of the rectangle, we have 2a+25b = 60. Simplifying it gives 2a+10b = 60. Since a = 5b, it follows that 2a = 25b = 10b. Therefore, 10b + 10b = 60, which gives b = 3 centimeters and a = 5b = 15 centimeters. Thus, the perimeter of the square is 4a = 415 = 60 centimeters.

Code python实现一个正则表达式匹配，要求能匹配到所有以139开头，以00结尾的11位数字 Implement a regular expression matching in Python, which should be able to match all 11-digit numbers that start with ”139” and end with ”00”. Responses Model Response Elo Qwen-7B-Chat (SFT) 你可以使用Python的re模块来实现这个正则表达式匹配。以 下是一个示例代码： import re def match phone numbers(phone numbers): pattern = r’ˆ139d9$’ return re . findall ( pattern , phone numbers) phone numbers = [’13900000000’, ’13912345678’, ’ 13998765432’, ’13987654321’] print(match phone numbers(phone numbers)) 在这个代码中，我们首先定义了一个正则表达式模式’ˆ139 d9$’，这个模式表示以139开头，以00结尾，且长度为11的 数字。然后我们使用re . findall 函数来查找所有匹配这个模 式的字符串，最后返回这些匹配的字符串。 注意，这个代码假设phone numbers是一个包含多个字符串的 列表。如果你的phone numbers是一个字符串，你需要先将其 转换为列表。 941 You can use the re module in Python to implement this regular expression matching. Here is an example code: import re def match phone numbers(phone numbers): pattern = r’ˆ139d9$’ return re . findall ( pattern , phone numbers) phone numbers = [’13900000000’, ’13912345678’, ’ 13998765432’, ’13987654321’] print(match phone numbers(phone numbers)) This code defines a regular expression pattern ˆ139d9$. This pattern represents a string that starts with ’139’, ends with ’00’, and has a length of 11 digits. Then, we use the re.findall function to find all the strings that match this pattern, and finally, we return these matching strings. Note that this code assumes that phone numbers is a list containing multiple strings. If your phone numbers is a string, you must first convert it to a list. 50 Qwen-14B-Chat (SFT) 你可以使用Python的re模块来实现这个正则表达式匹配。以 下是一个简单的例子： import re def match phone numbers(phone numbers): pattern = r’ˆ139d9$’ return [phone number for phone number in phone numbers if re .match( pattern , phone number)] phone numbers = [’13912345678’, ’13923456789’, ’ 13934567890’, ’13945678901’, ’13956789012’, ’13967890123 ’, ’13978901234’, ’13989012345’, ’13990123456’, ’ 13900000000’] print(match phone numbers(phone numbers)) 在这个例子中，我们定义了一个正则表达式模式’ˆ139d9$’， 它匹配以139开头，后面跟着9个任意数字，最后以0结尾的 字符串。然后我们使用re .match()函数来检查每个电话号码 是否匹配这个模式。如果匹配，我们就将这个电话号码添加 到结果列表中。 941 You can use the re module of Python to implement this regular expression matching. Here is a simple example: import re def match phone numbers(phone numbers): pattern = r’ˆ139d9$’ return [phone number for phone number in phone numbers if re .match( pattern , phone number)] phone numbers = [’13912345678’, ’13923456789’, ’ 13934567890’, ’13945678901’, ’13956789012’, ’13967890123 ’, ’13978901234’, ’13989012345’, ’13990123456’, ’ 13900000000’] print(match phone numbers(phone numbers)) In this example, we define a regular expression pattern ’ˆ139d9$’, which matches a string starting with 139, followed by nine arbitrary digits and ending with 0. Then we use the re .match() function to check if each phone number matches this pattern. If it does, we add this phone number to the result list. 51 Qwen-14B-Chat (RLHF) 可以使用Python的re模块来实现正则表达式匹配。以下是一 个示例代码： import re pattern = r’ˆ139d9$’ # 测试匹配 text = ’13912345678’ match = re .match( pattern , text ) if match: print(’匹配成功’) else : print(’匹配失败’) # 测试不匹配 text = ’139123456780’ match = re .match( pattern , text ) if match: print(’匹配成功’) else : print(’匹配失败’) 其中，ˆ表示匹配字符串的开头，d表示匹配数字，9表示匹 配9个数字，$表示匹配字符串的结尾。将这些符号组合在一 起，就可以得到一个匹配11位数字的正则表达式。 在测试匹配时，使用re .match()函数来尝试匹配文本，如果 匹配成功，返回一个Match对象，否则返回None。在本例 中，第一个测试匹配成功，第二个测试匹配失败。 1090 You can use the re module in Python to implement regular expression matching. Here is an example code: import re pattern = r’ˆ139d9$’ # Match Test text = ’13912345678’ match = re .match( pattern , text ) if match: print(’Success’) else : print(’Fail’) # Unmatch Test text = ’139123456780’ match = re .match( pattern , text ) if match: print(’Success’) else : print(’Fail’) Among them, ˆ represents matching the beginning of a string, d represents matching a digit, 9 represents matching 9 digits, and $ represents matching the end of a string. Combining these symbols, we can obtain a regular expression that matches 11 digits. When testing for a match, use the re .match() function to attempt to match the text. A successful match returns a Match object; otherwise, it returns None. In this example, the first test matches successfully, while the second test fails to match. 52 GPT-3.5 使用Python的re模块可以很方便地实现正则表达式匹配。以 下是一个匹配所有以139开头，以00结尾的11位数字的示例 代码： import re text = ”139123456700” pattern = r”ˆ139d800$” match = re .match( pattern , text ) if match: print(”匹配成功”) else : print(”匹配失败”) 输出结果为： 匹配成功 代码中，首先定义了一个文本字符串text，用于测试正则表 达式的匹配。接着定义了一个正则表达式 pattern ，其中ˆ139 表示以139开头，d8表示任意8位数字，00$表示以00结尾。 然后使用re .match()函数进行匹配，如果匹配成功，则输 出”匹配成功”，否则输出”匹配失败”。 1043 The re module in Python can conveniently accomplish regular expression matching. Below is an example code that matches all 11-digit numbers beginning with 139 and ending with 00. import re text = ”139123456700” pattern = r”ˆ139d800$” match = re .match( pattern , text ) if match: print(”Success”) else : print(”Fail”) Output: Success In the code, a text string ”text” is first defined for testing regular expression matching. Then, a regular expression ”pattern” is defined, where ”ˆ139” means starting with 139, ”d8” means any eight digits, and ”00$” means ending with 00. Then, the re .match() function is used for matching. If the match is successful, ”Success” is outputted; otherwise, ”Fail” is outputted. 53 GPT-4 下面是你需要的python代码，这段代码中使用了python的re模 块。 import re def match phone number(string) : pattern = ”ˆ139d600$” return re .match( pattern , string ) is not None # 测试 print(match phone number(”13912345600”)) # 输出: True print(match phone number(”15912345600”)) # 输出: False print(match phone number(”13912345601”)) # 输出: False print(match phone number(”139123456000”)) # 输出: False 在这里，”ˆ139d600$”是正则表达式。”ˆ”表示匹配字符串的 开始，”139”匹配字符串中的”139”，”d6”匹配任意六个数 字，”00”匹配字符串中的”00”，“$”表示匹配字符串的结束。 因此，这个正则表达式可以匹配到所有以139开头，以00结 尾的11位数字。 1134 Below is the python code you need. This code uses the python re module. import re def match phone number(string) : pattern = ”ˆ139d600$” return re .match( pattern , string ) is not None # Test print(match phone number(”13912345600”)) # Output: True print(match phone number(”15912345600”)) # Output: False print(match phone number(”13912345601”)) # Output: False print(match phone number(”139123456000”)) # Output: False In here, ”ˆ139d600$” is a regular expression. ”ˆ” represents the beginning of the string, ”139” matches the ”139” in the string, ”d6” matches any six digits, ”00” matches the ”00” in the string, and ”$” represents the end of the string. Therefore, this regular expression can match any 11-digit number that starts with 139 and ends with 00. Code 我用下面代码求二叉树的最大深度，但是答案不对，怎么回事呢？ d e f maxDepth ( s e l f , r o o t : TreeNode ) −> i n t : i f n o t r o o t : r e t u r n 0 queue , r e s = [ r o o t ] , 0 w hil e queue : tmp = [ ] f o r node i n queue : i f node . l e f t : tmp . append ( node . l e f t ) i f node . r i g h t : tmp . append ( node . l e f t ) queue = tmp r e s += 1 r e t u r n r e s I use the following code to find the maximum depth of a binary tree, but the answer is incorrect.

In your code, you first add the root node to the queue, then enter a loop until the queue is empty. In each loop, you add the left child node and right child node of all nodes in the queue to the queue. Then, you increase the depth counter res. Finally, you return the depth counter res. Qwen-14B-Chat (SFT) 你的代码会返回二叉树的节点数量，而不是最大深度。这是 因为你在每次循环中都增加了res的值，而不是只在找到新 的最深节点时增加。你可以通过在找到新的最深节点时才增 加res的值来修复这个问题。以下是修复后的代码： def maxDepth(self, root : TreeNode) −> int: if not root : return 0 queue, res = [ root ], 0 while queue: tmp = [] for node in queue: if node. left : tmp.append(node. left ) if node. right : tmp.append(node. right ) queue = tmp if len(queue) > res: res = len(queue) return res 949 Your code will return the number of nodes in the binary tree, not the maximum depth. This is because you increase the value of ”res” in every loop, instead of only increasing it when a new deepest node is found. You can fix this problem by increasing the value of ”res” only when a new deepest node is found. Here is the modified code: def maxDepth(self, root : TreeNode) −> int: if not root : return 0 queue, res = [ root ], 0 while queue: tmp = [] for node in queue: if node. left : tmp.append(node. left ) if node. right : tmp.append(node. right ) queue = tmp if len(queue) > res: res = len(queue) return res 55 Qwen-14B-Chat (RLHF) 这个代码的问题在于它没有正确地处理左右子树的深度。具 体来说，每次从队列中取出一个节点时，它会将该节点的左 右子树都加入到队列中，然后将队列长度加一。但是，如果 该节点的左右子树中有一个为空，那么这个节点的深度就应 该是它所在队列的长度减一，而不是队列长度加一。 以下是修改后的代码： def maxDepth(self, root : TreeNode) −> int: if not root : return 0 queue, res = [ root ], 0 while queue: tmp = [] for node in queue: if node. left : tmp.append(node. left ) if node. right : tmp.append(node. right ) queue = tmp res = max(res, len(queue)) return res 在这个代码中，每次取出一个节点时，我们只将该节点的左 右子树中非空的部分加入到队列中，并计算队列的长度。然 后，我们将队列长度与当前最大深度进行比较，并更新最大 深度。这样就可以正确地计算出二叉树的最大深度了。 992 The problem with this code is that it does not correctly handle the depth of the left and right subtrees. Specifically, when a node is taken out from the queue, it adds both its left and right subtrees to the queue and increases the length of the queue by one. However, if either the left or right subtree of the node is empty, then the depth of this node should be the length of the queue minus one, not the length of the queue plus one. Here is the modified code: def maxDepth(self, root : TreeNode) −> int: if not root : return 0 queue, res = [ root ], 0 while queue: tmp = [] for node in queue: if node. left : tmp.append(node. left ) if node. right : tmp.append(node. right ) queue = tmp res = max(res, len(queue)) return res In this code, when each node is extracted, we only add the nonempty parts of its left and right subtrees to the queue, and calculate the length of the queue. Then, we compare the length of the queue with the current maximum depth and update the maximum depth. This way, we can correctly calculate the maximum depth of the binary tree. 56 GPT-3.5 问题出在第11行代码，在将node. right 添加到ttmp列表时， 应 该 是tmp.append(node. right )而 不 是tmp.append(node. left ) 。修改后的代码如下： def maxDepth(self, root : TreeNode) −> int: if not root : return 0 queue, res = [ root ], 0 while queue: tmp = [] for node in queue: if node. left : tmp.append(node. left ) if node. right : tmp.append(node. right ) queue = tmp res += 1 return res 1090 The problem lies in line 11 of the code. When adding node. right to the tmp list, it should be tmp.append(node. right ) instead of tmp .append(node. left ). The modified code is as follows: def maxDepth(self, root : TreeNode) −> int: if not root : return 0 queue, res = [ root ], 0 while queue: tmp = [] for node in queue: if node. left : tmp.append(node. left ) if node. right : tmp.append(node. right ) queue = tmp res += 1 return res GPT-4 你的代码中有一个错误： 你在这一行代码if node. right : tmp.append(node. left ) 中应 该是想把右子节点加入到tmp列表中，但是你写的是node. left ，这样就只会把左子节点加入到tmp列表中。正确的应 该是node. right 。 正确的代码如下： def maxDepth(self, root : TreeNode) −> int: if not root : return 0 queue, res = [ root ], 0 while queue: tmp = [] for node in queue: if node. left : tmp.append(node. left ) if node. right : tmp.append(node. right ) queue = tmp res += 1 return res 这种解法的思路是：每次迭代时，都把当前层的所有节点 遍历一遍，同时把下一层的所有节点都加到下一次迭代的队 列中。所以每次迭代完，深度res就加1。直到遍历的队列为 空，此时的深度就是二叉树的最大深度。 1095 57 There is an error in your code: In this line of code if node. right : tmp.append(node. left ), you should be adding the right child node to the tmp list, but you wrote node. left instead, so only the left child node will be added to the tmp list. The correct code should be node. right . The correct code is as follows: def maxDepth(self, root : TreeNode) −> int: if not root : return 0 queue, res = [ root ], 0 while queue: tmp = [] for node in queue: if node. left : tmp.append(node. left ) if node. right : tmp.append(node. right ) queue = tmp res += 1 return res The idea of this solution is: in each iteration, traverse all the nodes in the current level, and add all the nodes in the next level to the queue for the next iteration. So after each iteration, the depth res is increased by 1. Continue this process until the queue for traversal is empty, and the depth at that time is the maximum depth of the binary tree. A.3 ANALYSIS OF CODE INTERPRETER Here we provide a case of comparison between CODE LLAMA and QWEN-CHAT. This case demonstrates the advantages of QWEN-CHAT in processing tabular data and performing complex tasks. 58 Code Llama User Code Llama User Qwen Chat User Figure 5: Example showcasing QWEN-CHAT’s ability in using a code interpreter via ReAct prompting. The ReAct instruction is omitted for clarity. QWEN creates a two-step plan and first investigates the columns present in the CSV file before proceeding to draw the plot, as shown in the top-left figure. CODE LLAMA, however, attempts to draw the plot based on non-existent columns in its initial attempt, as seen in the bottom figure. CODE LLAMA can only reliably perform the task if the columns are provided in the user query, as shown in the top-right figure. 59
